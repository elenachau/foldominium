The stick figure for this CP will look like this.


For this specific model the stick figure doesnâ€™t really tell that much, because the model also makes
use of the fact that due to paper thickness the flaps (which theoretically are all coming from the same
point in the stick figure) will be spread apart and create a voluminous 3D body.
But at least theoretically the collapsed base will look similar to the stick figure.

To make things easier for the folder I usually show the meaning of the flaps in a separate drawing along
with the CPs I publish.
When designing a box pleated model, the main challenge is to create such a square packing to fit the
intended stick figure by arranging squares of different size into a square.

With this we have gathered the most important information from the CP and can commence with the
folding.
