         How to fold Box Pleated CPs
                    Part 1 - Understanding the CP
Weâ€™ll start with a CP in the form which you will most likely encounter on the Internet, namely with
no information included except for the creases.
This design of mine will become an (Old World) Porcupine and I chose it for this guide because it
offers most of the challenges you will encounter in box pleated CPs while still being of an intermediate
difficulty level.


Before we start folding we will need to understand this CP a bit better.
How many flaps are there? Where are the flaps? How long are the flaps?

The end points of the flaps can be determined very easily in the CP. They are the points where both
horizontals and both diagonals come together. For points on the edge of the paper you will have to add
the missing lines that would be outside of the paper in thought.
