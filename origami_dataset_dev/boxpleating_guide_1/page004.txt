All of what I have explained so far works well for what I like to call “perfect” square packings, i.e.
each flap only takes up the space it needs without any “wasted” space. In such cases the square packing
only consists of squares and rivers.
But there are several reasons when the designer needs to put more paper into a flap, f.e. so that the
paper can be spread in the finishing process to create broader flaps for wings, clothes etc, or because
a perfect square packing is not possible at all. A flap like this would look like the following drawing


When you look at this part closely you will notice that it actually is just a normal flap square with some
pleats added in the middle.


The four white pleats in the above drawing represent the extra paper you will have in this flap. How
and if this extra paper will be used depends on the intended function of the flap.
One interpretation that always works and has the advantage to create a perfect square packing as
described above is to turn the extra paper into several small 1 unit flaps.
The resulting CP would look as follows with several small flap squares surrounded by a river. A
structure like this could for example be used as a leg with claws on the paws.


So after you have assigned squares to the CP you will have to look out for rectangles like this as well
to complete the flap assignment. In the case of my porcupine this is not necessary since my CP uses
a perfect square packing (by my own definition).
