Let’s try this for one point in the CP.


                       1 unit flap - ok    2 unit flap - ok   3 unit flap - fail
We see that this flap is 2 units long. Let’s do this for the rest of the CP.


What is left between the squares are so called rivers, which will separate the flaps from each other.
Those might for example be arms that separate the fingers from the rest of the model, a neck that
separates the head from the rest of the model, a body that separates the arms from the legs, etc.
