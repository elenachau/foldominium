With this assignment of squares to the CP we have arrived at the form of CP I usually use when
publishing CPs for my models, i.e. showing the CP together with the square packing.


When it comes to specifying, which flap will become which part of the model there is no generic
method to do this but you will learn from experience.
For example in the corners of this model you see some small flaps next to each other. Structures like
this will in most cases become fingers or toes, which implies that the surrounding rivers will be arms
or legs.

Using the information we gathered, you could also create a stick-figure of the model to get a better
understanding of how the base will look like and to get an idea of what the different flaps might be
used for.

For constructing the stick-figure there are some simple rules to follow.
The length of a line in the stick-figure equals the lenght of the flap in the CP.
Flaps that are not separated by a river will start at the same point.
If two flaps are separated by a river the distance between their starting points equals the width of the
river.
