Letâ€™s apply this knowledge to the CP at hand.


You should find 36 flaps in this CP which is quite a lot.
To determine the length of the flaps we first have to know how a flap looks like in the CP.
A flap will always have the form of a square in varying sizes with the just found end points as centre.
An exception are edge flaps which might seem to be rectangles because a part of the square is outside
of the paper.
                                             1 unit flap

                                             2 unit flap

                                             3 unit flap

                                             4 unit flap

The crease distribution inside a flap square will always look exactly the same, so when trying to find
the length of a flap we are looking for the largest possible square around the flap end point which looks
like in the picture above.
