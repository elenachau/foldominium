                                shows that it is possible to fnd the more representative design rules (tree branches) using the F-score function. 
                                To achieve this inverse design method, we developed an open-access code package to analyze the trained ran-
                                dom forest classifcation model, and to back track all tree branches (design rules) associated with the class that 
                                meet the target performance. Tis new code implementation then ranks the design rules and picks the most 
                                representative one using the proposed selection methodology. Further details on the inverse design workfow 
                                can be found in the Supplementary Document Section S3. Te implementation code package of this work can be 
                                found on GitHub: https:// github. com/ zzhuy ii/ TreeF orOri gami.

                                Evaluation criterion.      Common evaluation indices for machine learning, including the precision and the 
                                recall, are used to evaluate the performance of design rules. Te precision is defned as the ratio between the 
                                number of accurate predictions of Class t over the number of all predictions of Class t 38. In Fig. 2e, Rule 1 (blue 
                                dots) predicts 10 data points as Class 1, and 9 of them are correct so it has a precision of 0.9. Te recall is defned 
                                as the accurate predictions of Class t over the number of all data of Class t 38. In Fig. 2e, suppose we have a total 
                                number of 30 points in the target zone (within the blue decision boundary), then Rule 1 will have a recall of 0.3 
                                (9/30).
