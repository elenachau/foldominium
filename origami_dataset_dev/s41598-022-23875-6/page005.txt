                            setup: two origami patterns are compared for their performance as a metasheet. (b) Design rules for diferent 
                            axial stifness targets when the metasheet is at a 60% extension. (c) Design rules for the bending stifness at 
                            a 90% extension. (d) Sample designs for the four selected design targets. (e) Design rules afer adding design 
                            features regarding the materials stifness. (f) Design realizations of the origami metasheet afer adding materials 
                            stifness as design features.

                            the diferent origami systems (details in the Supplementary Materials Section S2). In this example, we separately 
                            design the metasheet for two targets including the axial stifness ka at 60% extension and the bending stifness 
                            kb at 90% extension (design for multiple targets/objectives is discussed in the next section). As before, we defne 
                            the extension of the origami ( Ext ) as the ratio between the folded length to the fat length. Four stifness target 
                            zones are created for both the axial stifness and the bending stifness as indicated in Fig. 3b and c.
                              We frst study the design for axial stifness ka at 60% extension (see Fig. 3b). Assume that we want to design 
                            an origami metasheet to have 15, 000 N/m < ka < 30, 000 N/m (Zone a1), we can label data that meet the target
