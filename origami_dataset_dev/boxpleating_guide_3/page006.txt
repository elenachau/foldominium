We can now practice the Elias stretch a bit more by making two smaller ones at the top.


           When both of them are done the CP would look
           like this. Note that with those two Elias stretches
           we will get three distinct flaps at the top. They
           will be shorter than the flaps at the bottom though.


        Open out the layers       Form the shown
         on the left a bit.        mountain fold.


                                                    Close the model using
                                                     the shown creases.


               Done.         Make another Elias
                             stretch on the right.

           Taking a look at this base and the associated stick Arm Arm
           figure, it might be suitable for a human-like figure
           (with a bit short arms).
           So just give it a try and see what you can turn
           this base into.

In the next part we will perform an Elias stretch that is a lot more complex (and doesnâ€™t really look
like an Elias stretch) on the Porcupine model.
