         How to fold Box Pleated CPs
                         Part 1II - Collapsing 1

Before we start the collapsing, weâ€™re going to take another look at the structure of the CP which still
holds some information that can help us a lot in the collapsing process.


The first thing to note is the symmetrie line of the
CP.
Since most box pleated CPs are symmetric this will
be the centre line of the square in most cases.
If the CP is not symmetric you will have to find a
line that separates the CP logically in two halves.
You will want to choose a line that goes through the
centre of a lot of flaps because that makes the folding
process easier.


The other thing to note are lines in the square packing
perpendicular to the symmetry line that go all the
way from one side to the other side of the square.
Those lines separate the CP into parts that can be
collapsed more or less independent from the other
parts of the CP.


For each of the steps that will come now I will display a partial CP that shows all the creases necessary
for getting a collapsed stage at this point, as well as the full CP greyed out as comparison to see the
progress. The new or changed creases for each step will be displayed thicker.
For now we will focus on the top part of the CP that will become head and fore legs.
