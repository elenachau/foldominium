Before we continue we will make a small excursus about Elias stretches, with some simpler examples
before we perform a rather extensive Elias stretch on the model at hand.
The Elias stretch is a very important technique in box pleating, which generally is used for separating
two flaps from each other.


       Letâ€™s start with an ...and add some     Now pleat    ...to get something
          8 x 8 grid...    diagonals to it.    vertically...    like this.

           We now want to perform an Elias stretch to
           separate the bottom two corners. In the CP the
           finished Elias stretch would look like this.
           Note that all folds we are going to make are on
           already existing creases (as is the case for most
           steps in collapsing a box pleated base).


   First we have to        Then we start by       Next we form the
   stretch the layers     forming the shown     shown valley folds and
  apart, which is easy     mountain folds.        pinch the corners.
   in this example.


      Elias stretch done.   Finish the Elias stretch by Pinch the corners further
    We now have created        closing the model.       while forming the shown
     two separate flaps.   The shown creases will form     mountain folds.
                              mostly by themselves.
