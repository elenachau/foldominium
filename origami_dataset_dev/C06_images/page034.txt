Degree 6, symmetric vertex

Consider a symmetric, degree-6 vertex.  We want to   
self-fold it to a target state (1, -3.7, 1, -3.7, 1, -3.7).
  
                                            

                                                             
The “obvious” driving force would be to push the 
                                               
creases to be (V, M, V, M, V, M), right?
