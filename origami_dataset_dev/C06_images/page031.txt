What is self-folding?

A nice continuous folding           from a rigid folding             to           is  
self-foldable by driving force             if for all                      the forward force 
at             on the conﬁguration space is positive and takes on a local maximum 
among the valid tangents at    .

That is, you want the dot product of             and 
to be positive.  It makes sense!

                                                         f~(~⇢ (s))
                                            ~⇢ (0)
                                                               ⇢2


We say that a nice continuous folding          is uniquely self-foldable if            is 
the only nice continuous folding that is self-foldable by     .
