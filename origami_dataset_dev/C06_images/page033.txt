Back to the degree 4 case

Theorem: For every rigidly, ﬂat-foldable degree-4 vertex with arbitrary target 
and starting conﬁgurations, there exists a driving force that makes the vertex 
uniquely self-foldable.

                                                    ⇢1

Proof:  Assume that the target        is on mode 1. 
We want to ﬁnd a potential function                       ~⇢ (1)
such that 
(1)            monotonically decreases along mode 1 
                                                  ~⇢ (0)
toward the target state and                                      ⇢2
(2)            monotonically decreases along mode 2 
toward the ﬂat state. 
 
The following works:      4
         1                   1
U(~⇢ )=     ~⇢  ~⇢  2 =        (⇢    ⌧ )2
         2k   −  T k         2   i −  i
                         i=1
where       are the coordinates ofX the target conﬁguration.
