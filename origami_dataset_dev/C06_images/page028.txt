   Conﬁguration space of a ﬂat-foldable, deg 4 vertex

  What does the conﬁguration space look like?

  Note: (1) The ﬂat state                 is a singularity (or a branch point) of the 
  conﬁguration space manifold.  This means that folding from the ﬂat state is 
  harder than unfolding to the ﬂat state.  :-) 
            (2)  The conﬁg space is symmetric about the origin (reversing MVs).
