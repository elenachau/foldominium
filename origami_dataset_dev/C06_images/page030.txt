What is self-folding?

A nice continuous rigid folding           from a rigid folding           to            is an 
arc-length parameterized piecewise         curve in a conﬁguration space.  At 
each point there will be at most two tangent vectors: 
 
 
 
The set of all such tangent vectors for all nice continuous rigid foldings passing 
through a conﬁguration point projected onto the unit sphere is called the set of 
valid tangents. 
 
We deﬁne the constrained forces along a nice continuous rigid folding          to 
be                                                    (the forward force) and         ⇢   1
