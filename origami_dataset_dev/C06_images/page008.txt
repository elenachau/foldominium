                                    Mechanical Meta-materials from Self-folding Polymer Sheets

  Scientific Goals:           Understanding mechanics of origami structures in order to fabricate “self-folding” polymer gels with designed
                              mechanical properties.

  Design Goals:               Creating new structures using novel polymer materials (origomu) and developing the design tools to engineer
                              these new materials.

   Taking advantage of inhomogeneous swelling, polymer gels can be patterned to reversibly fold at Any self-folding structure is subject to becoming trapped in metastable states or otherwise misfolding.
