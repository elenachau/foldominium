 Conﬁguration space of a ﬂat-foldable, deg 4 vertex

Conﬁguration space: n-dimensional parameter space containing points 
                                    where the        are all the folding angles will contain the 
conﬁguration space containing all such points that satisfy the rigid folding 
constraints:   Around every vertex we must have
