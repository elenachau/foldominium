Degree 6, symmetric vertex

How do we “push” the creases to fold through singularities (like the ﬂat, 
unfolded state) to the conﬁguration we want?


Here’s the idea:  Choose a driving force       that  
(a) pushes the state along the desired path (making                        ), and 
(b) is orthogonal to other, undesired manifolds at all singular points.
