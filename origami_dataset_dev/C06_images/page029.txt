What is self-folding?

To self-fold, each crease needs an actuator of some kind.


                                                  
Each actuator applies torque. 
We call the collection of these torques 
at all the creases the driving force of the 
folding, which we can think of as a 
vector ﬁeld on the conﬁguration space.


                                                       
In a separable driving force, each actuator only 
knows its own folding angle.  I.e., 


A conservative driving force is the gradient of a potential function:

                    f~ =     U(~⇢ )
For example, if we’re lucky wer could try the driving force:
