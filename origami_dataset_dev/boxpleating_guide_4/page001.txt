         How to fold Box Pleated CPs
                         Part 1II - Collapsing 2

Starting where we left the CP in the last part we are now going perform a sort of Elias stretch that goes
all the way across the square, i.e. we are going to make the stretch up until where we reach the shown
diagonals. Those diagonals will be our reference lines for the Elias stretch and will be displayed thicker
in all the drawings.


I will show this Elias stretch in several steps.
As was explained in the last part, to start with the Elias stretch, we first pull the layers apart a bit.
Note that in the following drawings I will only show the front half of the model to make things less
confusing (and easier for me to draw).
