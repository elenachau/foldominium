Now, after this extended Elias stretch, let’s lean back for a bit and take a look at the CP to check our
progress. We’re only interested in the shaded part for now.

The two shaded areas still need some fixing. In the square packing those two areas are divided by a
continuous horizontal line. As I explained in the last part a division like this means that those two areas
can be folded independently from each other. The Elias stretch we just made separated those two areas
from each other.
In general when folding a box pleated CP you should attempt a Divide-and-Conquer approach like this
working from the symmetrie line outwards instead of trying to collapse everything at once.
In the next part we’ll see how to finish the two shaded areas.
