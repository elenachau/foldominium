Starting from the bottom, pleat horizontally over the whole length of the square, until you reach
the marked intersection of the reference diagonals.
The uppermost valley fold is not folded completely. The pleated layers should be left standing
up from the rest of the model so that is looks like in the drawing on the right when viewed from
the side.


Close up the left side of the model using the shown creases to complete this part of the Elias stretch.


Continue to pleat upwards along the diagonal until you reach the marked intersection of the reference
diagonals. Close the model from the left while doing so.


Push in where shown and close the model up further.
