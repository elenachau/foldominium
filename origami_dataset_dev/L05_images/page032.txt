 Uniaxial Bases


 1. in z≥0 half plane
 2. intersection with z=0 plane = projection onto the 
 plane
Traditional
 3. partition of faces into ﬂaps, each projecting to a line 
 segment
 4. hinge crease shared by two ﬂaps project to a point
 5. graph of ﬂap projections as edges is a tree
 6. only one point of paper folds to each leaf

Previous deﬁnition of uniaxial bases
(6) not necessary but convenient
Why would it be useful to have the end of a leaf node map to more than one point on 
paper? Ans: ﬂap thickness at end
What does this really mean?
