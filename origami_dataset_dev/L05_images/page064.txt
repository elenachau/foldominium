        Useful Features in TreeMaker
 Conditions 
  • axis of symmetry conditions
  • force paths to be active or at speciﬁc angles
  • force nodes to edge/corner/speciﬁc locations
 Tree manipulation
  • adding local strain (Menu/Action/Scale Selection/)
  • triangulation (Menu/Edit/Stub/Triangulate Tree/)
 Views
  • Menu/View/Show View Settings/ very useful
  • Can view just locus of hinge creases by turning off 
  all but (Creases/Minor Creases) and (Creases/Lines)

                                         46
Symmetry (book/diagonal)
Identifying/ﬁxing unconstrained nodes with local strain
Triangulation of creasepattern (need three degrees of freedom)
