     Possible Problems in Optimization 

Problem:  A polygon bounded by active paths is concave 
Solution:  add extra leaf node in interior & expand 
        (split polygon into multiple convex polygons)

Problem:  A polygon bounded by active paths contains an 
unconstrained node
Solution:  add local strain to interior node to create 
additional active paths

Problem:  Optimizer can not Ô¨Ånd a solution due to trying 
to optimize under too many constraints
Solution:  decrease the number of additional constraints
