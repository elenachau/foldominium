“three easy steps: precrease, collapse, shape.” But in each case, the precreasing, the collapsing, and most
especially, the shaping, may require several hours for each step.
    In this ﬁgure, the collapse is relatively simple – only a few tens of creases are involved. (Truly advanced
designs may have hundreds of creases participating in the single collapse step.) The result at the end of the
collapse step is a ﬂat form: the origami base, shown in Figure 5. It doesn’t look like much—certainly, not
like a scorpion—but it contains a ﬂap of exactly the right length, connected in exactly the right way, for every
leg, arm, pincer, and body segment of the desired subject.

    The ﬂaps have the right length and connectivity, but not the right width; in fact, most of them are much
wider than their corresponding body part. As problems go, that’s a pretty good one to have; it’s a lot easier
to make a fat ﬂap narrower than to make a narrow ﬂap wider, and with arthropods as subject matter, making
ﬂaps narrower is the usual requirement. We will need to narrow all parts of this base so that they can better
represent the skinny legs, arms, and tail of the scorpion. This is done with a series of what are called “sink
