    To some degree, the Bug Wars are still going on, but with far more than bugs as their subject matter—
complex origami subjects include other animals, plants, human ﬁgures, and indeed, purely geometric forms—
and the goals of origami artists have moved well beyond “mere realism,” to now address the question,“how
can I create a visually interesting shape that challenges the mind and perceptions of the viewer?” Design
techniques have grown as well; circle-river packing has been expanded to include techniques based on pack-
ings of polygons and other shapes, and the ranks of other algorithms for computational origami continues to
grow, with contributions now coming from the academic world of computational geometry and other parts
of mathematics and computer science. It is a heady time.
    And yet, all of these techniques are still no more than tools in the hands of the artist. I am sometimes
asked if the development of mathematical design techniques (or, heaven forbid, computer programs!) some-
how diminishes origami as an artistic activity. To which I answer: these techniques, for all their power, are
still just tools, no more than a painter’s pigments, or a sculptor’s chisels. The quality of the tool does not
set the quality of the artwork; what matters most is what you do with those tools. But seeing what origami
artists from all over the world have done in recent decades with the tools that computational origamists have
given them, and an entirely new generation of conceptual and computational tools coming down the pike, I
have no doubt that the future of origami as an art form will be exciting and invigorating for many years to
come.
