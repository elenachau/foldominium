                              4.0 Reference

    4.1  Introduction

 This section describes the user interface of TreeMaker; it gives a comprehensive description of
the main window, how you construct a tree, and lists all of the menu commands and describes all
of the dialogs. The reference complements the tutorials in the previous section. While you should
start with the tutorials, they only cover the most important parts of TreeMaker; it would be a
good idea at some point to read through all of the reference to make sure you are aware of all the
capabilities of the program.

   4.2   Main window

Each origami design is its own document and is displayed within a single window. An origami
design is composed of a number of interrelated “parts”; the 7 types of parts are called: node,
edge, path, poly, vertex, and crease — each of which has a graphical representation — and
conditions, which modify nodes, edges, or paths, and don’t have a direct visual representation.

Figures 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 show two views of a typical window that displays all of the different
parts.
