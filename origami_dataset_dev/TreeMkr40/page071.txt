Once a third node has been created, the
convex hull of the nodes (border paths)
will be outlined as is shown in figure
4.3.6.

Each edge of the tree corresponds to a
flap of the base. By repeatedly selecting
nodes and clicking, you can build up
arbitrarily complex trees with any
number and arrangement of flaps.

To remove a node or edge, simply select
it  by clicking on it and do one of the
following:

Select the Cut command, Edit menu

Select the Clear command, Edit menu

Hit the <delete> or <forward delete> key

Nodes, edges, and paths are some                       4.3.5
examples of “parts.” Attributes of parts
— the location of a node, the length of an
edge, and so forth — can be altered by
editing the part. How this is done is the
subject of the next section.

   4.4   Editing Parts

All parts (nodes, edges, paths, polys,
vertices, and creases) have attributes
associated with them. Some are
numerical settings; some describe
relationships to other parts. You can edit
many of these attributes in several ways.
The most direct is to double-click on the
part. Double-clicking brings up a dialog
that displays all of the attributes of the
part whether they are editable or not.
This section describes all of the editor
dialogs for each of the parts.

If a node is double-clicked, the Node
Editor is put up as shown in figure 4.4.1.
