The result is shown in figure 2.2.11.
After the dialog box is closed, you’ll see                 1
that the circles for nodes 6 and 7 circle        2
have turned green.

   of symmetry, the symmetry-related                       2

   You don’t have to set up any
   conditions on internal nodes (and in                     3
   fact any conditions you might set    3
   up on them are ignored) since the                             3
   position of internal nodes in the tree        5         6
   are irrelevant to the final crease             1.000     1.000
   pattern.

Now we have set up the conditions that
enforce symmetry. As mentioned above,                 2.2.11
the conditions don’t take effect until we
re-optimize the pattern. Select Optimize
Scale           Action
       from the       menu to re-                         1
optimize the crease pattern taking the
new conditions into account. Figure              2                 2
