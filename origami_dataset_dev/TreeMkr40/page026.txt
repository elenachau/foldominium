 The dialog box tells the index of the edge and which nodes the edge runs between; the desired
 length of the edge; two quantities called strain and stiffness (more on these later); an optional
 label; and whether there are any condition on the edge. We’ll change the length of the “head”
 flap by giving it a new length. Enter “0.6” in the Length field, which will make the head flap a
 bit over half the length of the arms and legs. If you like, you can also enter a label such as “head”
 in the Label field as well. Then click the OK button.

You’ll notice that the circle around node
1 has gotten smaller, as shown in figure
                                                          1
2.3.3. The radius of the circle around a                 head           5
terminal node is equal to the length of the 4            1       4
adjacent edge using the current scale of          3       0.600  1.000
the model (which is 0.1000). A terminal            1.000  2
node attached to a 1-unit-long edge has a
circle of radius 1×0.1 = 0.1 times the side
of the square. Since we shrank the edge
to a length of 0.6, the circle shrinks                    2
accordingly to a radius of 0.6×0.1 = 0.06.                1.000

You can also see that the length of the
edge (the number near the middle of the
edge) is now 0.6. The label, if you                       3
entered one, also appears above the index         5              6
of the edge.                               6       1.000         1.000   7

It’s probably worth a reminder that the
length of the blue line segment that
represents the edge hasn’t changed a                   2.3.3
whit; what matters is the numerical
length that appears next to it.
