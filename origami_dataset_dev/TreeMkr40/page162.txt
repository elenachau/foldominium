There are a couple of interesting aspects of these relationships that could be confusing:

1. A Poly can own other Polys, which are called subPolys.

2. Both Poly and Tree own Polys and hence (through inheritance) also own Nodes and
Paths. A Poly owns all Nodes that are fully enclosed by the Poly and owns all Paths that
connect those Nodes.

Both Poly and Path can own Creases. However, only the Tree can own Edges.

3. Both Nodes and Paths can own Vertices.

The owner for an object has a member variable that points back to the owner; e.g., the Node
object has a member variable, mOwnedNodes, that points to the NodeOwner.

Because the behavior of different types of Owners is similar, there is some logic to embedding
ownership behavior into a template class (e.g., Owner<Vertex>, Owner<Node>, etc.).
However, I found that it is easier to follow the code if I give each owner a unique name
(“mNodeOwner”) and use unique names for owned objects (“mOwnedNodes”). Also, as you
will see, there are some member functions unique to particular Owner classes.

Here are the types of objects that other objects own:

A terminal Node or ring Node may own a single Vertex that coincides with the position of the
Node.

The following types of Paths own Creases: active paths, spoke paths, ridge paths, and
optionally, ring paths.

Active paths, ring paths, and ridge paths can own internal vertices as well that lie along the paths.

A Poly owns radial Creases that connect to its reduced polygons and/or any ridge Crease. A
Poly also owns Creases that run between internal vertices. A Poly also owns its sub-polys.

A Tree owns its Nodes, Edges, Paths, and Polys.
