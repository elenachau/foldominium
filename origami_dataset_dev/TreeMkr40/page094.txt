The dialog computes all possible ways to fracture the poly and displays them in a popup menu,
cataloged by which edge is split and the length of the stub to be added. The location of the new
node and the distance of the split from the end of the edge is shown immediately below the
popup menu. Clicking OK results in the addition of a new terminal node and edge (a stub) to the
tree, which fractures the polygon into lower-order polygons. Figure 4.5.19 shows before and
after examples.

Note: you must explicitly call Build Polys again after fracturing a poly to build the new polys.

 This command repeatedly tries to fracture every active polygon of order-4 or higher until all
 active polygons are triangles. If you then build creases, you will get all mountain, valley, and
 tristate creases in the model making rabbit-ear patterns. Figure 4.5.20 shows a typical before and
 after example.
