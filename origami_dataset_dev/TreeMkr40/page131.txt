If you’ve stuck with me so far, you’re now at the goal: an algorithm for finding a crease pattern
to fold a base with any number of points from a square, rectangle, or any other shape paper. (In
fact, this algorithm even works for circular paper!) To summarize the algorithm:

   1. Draw a tree, or stick figure, of the base, labeling each edge with its desired length.

   2. Find a pattern of terminal nodes on the square that satisfies the tree theorem, namely,
   that the distance between any two nodes on the square is greater than or equal to their
   separation on the tree.

   3. Mark all of the active paths, paths whose actual length is equal to their minimum
   length. Identify the active polygons.

   4. For any active polygon with five or more sides, add a node and edge to the tree
   attached at an internal node of the polygon and make the edge as large as possible,
   thereby breaking up the active polygon into quads and triangles.

   5. Fill in each active polygon with quad and triangle crease patterns.
The good news is that using the algorithm described above, a base can be constructed for any tree
— in fact, there are usually many distinctly different solutions for a single tree. The bad news is,
as you might suspect from some of the above, constructing the crease pattern can be
computationally intensive.

(The worse news is that even when you have the crease pattern, folding it up into a base can be
infuriatingly difficult; there is rarely a step-by-step folding sequence. More often than not, you
need to precrease everything, then collapse the base all at once.)
