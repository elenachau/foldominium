 To set up this condition, click on node 4 and shift-click on node 5 to select them both. Then go to
 the Conditions menu and select the Nodes paired command.

Now that nodes 4 and 5 have a condition
on them, their node circles are also green                 1
as shown in figure 2.2.8. If you still have      2
them selected and click on the                                     2
                                        4                  1
Conditions menu, you’ll see that the                       1.000
Nodes paired command is checked.                 3
                                                                            5
                                                  1.000            4
                                                           2
We also need to pair nodes 6 and 7. You                             1.000
could do this the same way — select     2
nodes 6 and 7 and then select the Nodes
                                                           2          2
paired command — but there’s more                          1.000
than one way to place conditions on
nodes. So, just for the experience, we’ll                  3
do these a different way.               3
                                                                 3
Double-click on Node 6. This brings up           5         6
the Node Editor dialog, which is shown           1.000     1.000
in figure 2.2.9.
