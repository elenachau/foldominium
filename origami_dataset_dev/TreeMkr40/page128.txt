 Figure 5.19. (Left) Tree for a base with 5 equal flaps. (Right) Pattern of terminal nodes and
 active paths corresponding to this tree.
 Now suppose we wanted to add one more point to the star. That would entail adding one more
 terminal node — node G — to the active polygon network. On the tree graph, the new node
 would be connected to node F as shown in figure 5.20. (If we connected it to one of the other
 nodes that wouldn’t add another point; it would just lengthen an existing point.) Suppose the
 point has a length l. Then since all the other edges are 1 unit long, the tree theorem tells us that
the new terminal node must be separated from each of the other terminal nodes by a distance
(1+l).

We can visualize these constraints by imagining that each terminal node is surrounded by a circle
whose radius is equal to the length of the edge attached to that node in the tree. That is, nodes A–
E are surrounded by circles of unit radius, while node G is surrounded by a circle of radius l. The
requirement that G be separated from the other nodes by at least a distance (1+l) is equivalent to
the requirement that circle G not overlap with any other circle.
