As an example, construct the tree shown
in figure 3.4.1 that has four legs of
different lengths.                            3
                                                                    2
When you optimize this tree, you will get
an irregular quadrilateral. Building
                                                   2          1
creases gives you a “gusset quadrilateral”         0.400      0.600
as shown in figures 3.4.2 and 3.4.3.
