 course, be subsequently narrowed arbitrarily as desired). In fact, I conjecture the following: for
 any active polygon, the universal molecule is the crease pattern with the shortest total length of
 creases that collapses that polygon to the uniaxial base. Few creases translates into relatively few
 layers in the base (at least, until you start sinking edges to narrow them). And because you don’t
 have to arbitrarily add circles (and hence points) to a crease pattern to knock polygons down to
 quads and triangles (as you do using the classical tree method algorithm), bases made with the
 universal molecule tend to have less bunching of paper and fewer layers near joints of the base,
 resulting in cleaner and (sometimes) easier-to-fold models.

 As another example of the utility of the universal molecule, an article by Maekawa in Oru
 magazine illustrated the design of a tree structure using the string-of-beads/contour algorithm. In
 this algorithm, all terminal nodes are arranged around the outside of the square to form one large
 active polygon. Then fixed-size circles are added to the interior to break up the active polygon
 into quads and triangles. Figure 5.31 shows the tree and the circle pattern derived thereby.

Figure 5.31. (Left) tree and (right) crease pattern from Oru
Maekawa’s construction used rabbit ear molecules to fill in the triangles and a different, but
similarly versatile construction to fill in quads, called the arrowhead quad. The resulting crease
pattern is shown in figure 5.32. Because of the large number of interior circles, the crease pattern
is quite complex and is quite difficult to fold flat.
