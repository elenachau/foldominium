 • Rewrote TreeFile class to buffer file I/O, gaining over an order of magnitude in speed during
 Save/Open.

 • Converted mathematical classes (Minimax, ConstrainedMinimax, etc.) to templates

 • About… box is faster.
(3.7) 12-3-96

• Fixed a bug that affected the display of polygons in the main window and screwed up printing
on certain types of printers; also added a background to the main window.

• Added a background to valid polygons.

• Added crop marks in multipage printouts so you can print out large patterns on multiple sheets
and can accurately cut and paste them together

• Removed the unnecessary border around the square in the printout, which increases the size of
the largest square you can fit onto a single page to 7.5 in.

• UI is now updated to PP Constructor 2.3 format, including use of new LPrintout.

• Added a modest speed improvement to the “Fracture Poly” algorithm by eliminating some
unnecessary calculations

• Added new Path::mIsValidPath member variable, which is used in the improved polygon-
finding algorithm. Also added the corresponding display in the Path Editor.

• Big improvements in the polygon-finding algorithm; border paths don’t have to be active to
form polygons. Non-optimized but valid node arrangements will now form crease patterns.

• Improved the algorithm that identifies pinned nodes. Nodes are now pinned only by active
paths and the edges of the paper.

• Added offscreen drawing, which improves the look and feel.

• Tweaked the color scheme slightly for better visibility and contrast.

• Added a polygon editor. There’s nothing to change, but it does let you examine some of the
internal characteristics of polygons.
(4.0) 4-1-98 released

• Complete overhaul of software model. Standard objects — Node, Edge, Path, Poly, Tree —
have many new fields. Phased out the Fold object; introduced the Vertex, Crease, and Condition
objects.

• All objects are now descended from Part and have an index.

• Polys are now hierarchical. Objects can own one another.
