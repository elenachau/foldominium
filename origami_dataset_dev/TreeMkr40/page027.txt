Now we’ll also shrink the torso a bit.
Double-click on the torso and enter a
                                                          1
length of 0.75 in the Length field. Then                 head           5
click OK. The result is shown in figure     4            1       4
2.3.4.                                            3       0.600  1.000
                                                   1.000  2
We’ll also make this model symmetric
and will take this opportunity to learn a
third way of applying conditions. Open
                              Edit
up the Tree Editor by selecting the                       2
Tree… command from the   Edit menu                        0.750
and turn on book symmetry by clicking
on the “book” button.

Now we’ll apply conditions, but rather                    3
than selecting specific menu commands             5              6
or editing particular nodes as we did      6       1.000         1.000   7
before, we’ll create all the conditions at
once. Select the Edit Conditions…
command from the  Conditions menu.
You will be presented with a dialog as                 2.3.4
shown in figure 2.3.5.


                                      2.3.5

 The Condition Editor shows every condition that applies to every part. With it, you can create all
 three conditions within the same dialog. Select Node symmetric from the “Add…” popup menu,
 followed by selecting Nodes paired about symmetry line twice from the same popup.
