    Custom ViewÉ                       1G
 puts up the View Editor, which lets you change how the image is displayed on the screen and
 display any combination of settings, as shown in figure 4.5.9.


                                       4.5.9

The View Editor is a movable dialog and its settings take effect immediately so you can see what
the results of your settings are.

There are four buttons for preset combinations of settings:

Default — show the default view, which displays both the tree, node circles, polygons, and
creases.

Tree — show just the tree (stick figure)

Creases — show just the crease pattern.

All — show everything. For all but the simplest figures, this is too busy to be useful (see figure
4.5.10), but if you ever wanted to see all the “guts” of a TreeMaker design, this is the closest
thing to it.
