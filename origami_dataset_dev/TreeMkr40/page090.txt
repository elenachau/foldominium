 Everything.”

If you interrupt the calculation, you will be presented with the following dialog:


                                       4.5.13

Similarly, if the optimizer runs into problems, it may also interrupt the calculation and present
you with a dialog of explanation. You have the choice of continuing with the nodes in their
present positions or reverting to the state the nodes were in before the calculation. Even if you
revert, any creases you may have generated are irretrievably lost, but they are easily
reconstructed.

 This command is used to remove degrees of freedom in a pattern after a Optimize Scale
