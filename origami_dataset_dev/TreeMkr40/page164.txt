 The Tree class has two friend classes, TreeCleaner and TreeFile, which are utilized for
housecleaning and persistence, respectively.

The references contained by a Tree are summarized below. Names in bold refer to inherited
member variables.

 Node

 A Node is the data structure that represents a node of a planar graph. There are several types of
 planar graph utilized in TreeMaker; there is the top-level graph, which is the target of the
 modeling; but there are also sub-graphs that are used in the process of insetting polygons.

 There are two types of Node. A “tree node” is a node that is part of the tree and is owned by the
 tree. Tree nodes come in two flavors: terminal nodes, which have exactly one edge, and internal
 nodes, which represent nodes where two or more edges come together.

 A “poly node” is a node that is owned by a poly. Poly nodes are the reduced images of tree
 nodes; so all poly nodes are also reduced nodes.
