                                      3.4.7

 Only top-level polygons can be fractured in this version of TreeMaker. Click inside the largest
 polygon (but outside of the two sub-polygons) to select it. Then select Fracture Poly… from the
Action menu, which puts up the dialog shown in figure 3.4.7.

There is frequently more than one way to fracture a poly. This dialog lists all possibilities in a
popup menu, cataloged by which edge is split and what the length of the new edge would be.
Below the popup menu is listed the location of the new node and the distance that the split is
from one of the nodes along the edge. Choose edge 3 from the popup and click OK.

Enter the index of the polygon to
fracture. (Since we only have one active                   2
polygon in this figure, its index is 1.)
Then click OK. The result is shown in           1
figure 3.4.8.                           3                   1
