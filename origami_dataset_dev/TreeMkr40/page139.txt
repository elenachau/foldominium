Figure 5.32. Crease pattern from Oru using arrowhead quad and rabbbit-ear molecules.
We can simplify the crease pattern obtained for the same terminal node positions by adding a
smaller number of interior circles and inflating each new circle to its maximum size before
adding the next, as described above. It turns out that we need add only three nodes to insure that
all active polygons have three or four sides. The resulting modified tree and crease pattern,
shown in figure 5.33, is reasonably simple to fold, and utilizes only rabbit-ear and gusset quad
molecules.

Figure 5.33. Tree and crease pattern for the Oru tree with three additional interior circles and
filled with triangle and gusset quads.
By applying the universal molecule to the original polygon, we can get a still simpler crease
pattern, which is shown in figure 5.34. This pattern has the additional perk that it is yet easier to
