         mOwnedPaths         All paths owned by this poly, which are one of the
                             following:

                             (1) paths that connect two owned nodes, i.e., ring or
                             cross paths or the ridge path

                             (2) paths from the outer poly to owned nodes, i.e.,
                             spoke paths

         mOwnedPolys         All subpolys of this poly

         mOwnedCreases       All creases that connect the edges of this poly to the
                             edges of its subpolys

         mRingNodes          The nodes that form the vertices of this polygon

         mRingPaths          The paths that form the edges of this polygon, i.e., an
                             ordered list of paths that connect consecutive vertex
                             nodes.

         mCrossPaths         All other paths that connect the mRingNodes, i.e.,
                             those paths connecting non-consecutive
                             mRingNodes.

         mInsetNodes         Mapping from ring nodes to inset nodes. Note that
                             several ring nodes may map to the same inset node,
                             i.e., this list may have duplicate entries.

         mSpokePaths         Paths that connect ring nodes to inset nodes for this
                             poly.

         mRidgePath          If the poly has exactly two distinct inset nodes, this is
                             the path that connects them. We need this path
                             because some creases may terminate on it.

         mPolyOwner          Poly or tree that owns this poly
Vertex

A Vertex is a point where two or more creases come together. The Vertex inherits only from
Part.

The references contained by a Vertex are summarized below. Names in bold refer to inherited
member variables.
