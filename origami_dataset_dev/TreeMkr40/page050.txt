However, we can force nodes to lie on
the edge of the paper, thereby turning the             2        1        3
associated flaps into edge flaps, by
setting conditions on them. Select all the     1
nodes, either by shift-clicking on each in
turn, or by choosing the Select All     4                                 1
command from the  Edit menu. Then                        1        2
select the Node fixed to edge command                    1.000     1.000
from the Condition menu, which applies
                                                 3
this condition to each node in the      1         1.000                     8
selection, as shown in figure 3.3.5.
                                                                   7
                                                                    1.000
Re-run the optimizer. (Because of a quirk                   1
                                                 4
in the optimization code, you may have                                     1
to re-run it several times sequentially to 5      1.000
force convergence.) When you do, you                     5        6
                                                1         1.000    1.000
will find that all the nodes now lie on the
edge of the paper, essentially forming                  6        1        7
one giant polygon. Select Build Polys
and Creases from the Action menu and
Creases Only from the View menu. This                  3.3.5
pattern results in the crease pattern
shown in figure 3.3.6.

Ease of collapsing the crease pattern into
a base is a good reason to force flaps to
be edge flaps; another good reason is the
number of layers. For a given width flap,
edge flaps have only half the number of
layers of middle flaps, and so if a flap is
to be folded further, it may be desirable
to make it be an edge flap to it will be
easier to fold.

Another reason to make a flap be an edge
flap is for color-changing. The bases
produced by TreeMaker are inherently
single-color. If you are making a model
that exploits the colors of both sides of
the paper — a bald eagle, for example,
which would have white head, tail, and
feet — then you will need to make sure
that the flaps to be color-changed are
edge flaps, so that they may be turned                 3.3.6
inside-out around the raw edges of the
flap. (It is extremely difficult to turn a middle flap inside-out!) Of course, color-changing
individual flaps is only the most rudimentary way of exploiting two-tone models and is
insufficient for models with stripes or spots, for example. For zebras, tigers, and giraffes, you’ll
have to use different techniques than those found in TreeMaker.
