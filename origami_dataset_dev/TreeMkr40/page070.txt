When an edge is first created, it will be
highlighted and will have a default length
of 1 unit.

Once there are two or more terminal
nodes, all terminal nodes will have a
circle shown around them whose radius
is equal to the scaled length of the
attached edge.

In this example, node 2 is selected, so
clicking in a new location will create
another new node and edge as shown in
figure 4.3.4.

Internal nodes (those with two or more
edges emanating from them) do not
display circles around them. However,
you can add branches to the tree that
emanate from an internal node by
selecting the internal node and then
                                                       4.3.3
clicking elsewhere in the square, as
shown in figure 4.3.5 and 4.3.6.
