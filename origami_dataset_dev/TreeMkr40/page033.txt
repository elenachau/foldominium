Now, all edges are pinned and we can
proceed with the construction of the
creas pattern. Select Build Polys and
Creases from the   Action menu to
construct the crease pattern and select
Creases Only from the View menu to
show just the creases, as shown in figure
2.3.13.

You now know how to set up a crease
pattern for a base with an arbitrary
number of flaps and how to change the
lengths of the flaps. You’ve also seen in
this tutorial how to set up and enforce
bilateral symmetry in the base. This gives
you 90% of what you need to know to
compute crease patterns with TreeMaker,
and I encourage you at this point to go
off and experiment. To keep things
simple (and to keep the optimization
times down), I have kept to small                     2.3.13
examples with a small number of flaps.
But you can try much more complicated
bases with much more complicated assemblies of flaps with TreeMaker; you are limited only by
the computer memory and speed (and of course, your own patience!). The next section will
address some of the subtler issues of origami design using TreeMaker. You can continue
working through it, or go off, experiment, and then come back when you’re ready.
