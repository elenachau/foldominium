Figure 5.8. The four active polygons for the six-legged base and the trees corresponding to each
subbase.
An incredibly useful property of active polygons is that although two polygons may share a
common side, if that side is an active path, any crease pattern that collapses one polygon into a
subbase is always compatible with a crease pattern that collapses the adjacent polygon into its
subbase! If you like, for example, you could cut up the square into separate polygons, fold each
polygon into a subbase, and then glue matching edges of the subbases back together and be
assured that they would match up. This matching property is unique to active paths, so any two
polygons that share a side that is an active path will be guaranteed to match up. The practical
upshot of this is that in order to find the creases that collapse the entire base, we can find crease
patterns that collapse each polygon into a section of the overall base, taking the polygons one at a
time. So here is a way to break up the design of a complicated base into a bunch of much simpler
bases. To collapse the entire square into a uniaxial base, it suffices to find a way to collapse each
polygon individually into the appropriate subbase.
