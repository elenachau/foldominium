Figure 5.29. Construction of the universal molecule for the polygon shown in figure 28.
Figure 5.29 shows the universal molecule. The initial hexagon is inset to the point that the two
horizontal reduced paths become active, and the hexagon is split into two triangles and rectangle.
The triangles are filled with rabbit ear creases; the rectangle is further inset, forming a Maekawa
molecule.

Figure 5.30 compares the crease pattern obtained from this polygon by adding an additional node
to the tree pattern (i.e., adding a middle flap) and that obtained with the universal molecule. (Tri-
state creases are shown as dotted lines.)


Figure 5.30. (Left) Crease pattern obtained by adding an additional node to the hexagonal active
polygon. (Right) Crease pattern obtained by using the universal molecule.
A nice feature of the universal molecule is that it is very frugal with creases. A tree filled in with
universal molecules tends to have relatively few creases and large, wide flaps (which can, of
