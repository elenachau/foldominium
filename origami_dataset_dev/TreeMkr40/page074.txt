 Like the Node Editor, the Edge Editor displays the index of the edge as well as the indices of the
 nodes at each end of the edge. The fields of the Edge Editor are:

 label — an optional label for the edge, which you can use any way you want

 length — the desired length of the edge, relative to all the other edges

 strain — the current strain of the edge, i.e., deviation from its desired length

 stiffness — the stiffness of the edge, i.e., how resistant it is to being strained

 There is also a set of controls for adding conditions to the edge. Again, look at the description of
 the Edit Conditions… command, Conditions menu, for a description of these controls.

At the lower left corner, clicking on the disclosure triangle toggles between normal and Expert
Mode as shown in figure 4.4.4.


                                       4.4.4

As with nodes, the information shown in Expert Mode isn’t really necessary, but you might find
it interesting.

      Paths

If you double-click on a path, the Path Editor is put up as shown in figure 4.4.5.

   •Note: most paths are not visible, but you can call up the editor for any path (or any other
   part) using the Select Part… command, Edit menu.
