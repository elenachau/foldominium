Again, select Build Polys and Creases
from the Action menu, followed by
Creases Only from the View menu to
get the crease pattern shown in 3.2.16.

So you see, there are many ways of
adding circles to force a plan view base;
yet another demonstration that there are
many different ways of achieving a base
for the same basic design.

One final note: if you have two circles in
the interior of the model that are touching
along the center line, youâ€™ll have to add a
circle between them to force them apart.
The way to do this is to use a Nodes
collinear condition to force the new node
to lie between the other two.

   3.3   Forcing edge flaps

Once you have run several TreeMaker
designs and folded them, you will
eventually come to the realization that some crease patterns are easy to collapse into bases while
others are incredibly difficult to fold up. Closer examination of this phenomenon reveals a
common thread: the more middle points a base has, the harder it is to fold up. In addition, while
edge points can almost always be separated from the rest of the base by simply being folded out
to the side (perpendicular to the plane of the the base), middle points are often surrounded by
layers of paper and can only be separated out by being reverse-folded up and out of the model
(lying in the plane of the base). For these reasons, it is often desirable to force most of the flaps
in the base to be edge flaps.
