 This condition is used to force a particular path to be active, i.e., to have its actual length equal to
 its minimum length. This will insure that there is a crease between the two nodes that runs along
 the axis of the model. The fields of this condition are:

 — the index of the first node

 — the index of the second node
 Path angle fixed

                                       4.5.38

This condition is used to force a particular path to be both active and to lie at a given angle. It’s
used to make a crease pattern more symmetric. Its fields are:

— the index of the first node

— the index of the second node

— the angle that the path is forced to lie at

Note: if you have very many path angle fixed or path angle quantized constraints, it is very easy
to create incompatible constraints. Sometimes incompatible constraints can be relieved by
performing a strain optimization; other times you will simply have to remove some conditions.
Path angle quantized


                                       4.5.39

This condition is used to force a particular path to be active and to lie at one of a group of angles,
which are integer divisions of 180°. It’s used to make a crease pattern more symmetric by
requiring that major creases lie at “nice” angles. The fields are:

— the index of the first node

— the index of the second node

— the integer divisor for the angle quantization

— the first angle in the group

By applying this condition to most or all of the active paths in a model and performing a strain
optimization (which is usually necessary to satisfy all conditions), you can create a very
symmetric crease pattern, which is usually necessary if you want a sequentially foldable design.

The subsequent commands in the conditions menu apply and give the status of each of the types
of conditions. These commands may have a mark next to them giving the status of the current
