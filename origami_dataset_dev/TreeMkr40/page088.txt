   p — pinned node: node can’t be moved without violating a path constraint

   g — polygon node: node is a vertex of a valid polygon

   c — conditioned node: node has one or more conditions applied to it

Show edges — display the edges of the tree. Edges are shown as thick light blue lines. Pinned
edges are shown in a lighter blue.

Show edge indices — display the index of each edge at its midpoint

Show edge labels — display any labels defined for edges

Show edge length — display the length of each edge

Always show edge strain — display the edge strain even if it’s equal to zero

Show edge flags — display single-letter codes for the flags attached to each edge, which are:

   p — pinned edge: edge can’t be lengthed without violating a path constraint

   c — conditioned edge: edge has one or more conditions applied to it

Show terminal paths — display all paths between terminal nodes (nodes with only 1 edge). Paths
are shown as single-pixel-thick lines between nodes. Terminal paths are shown in red.

Show internal paths — display all paths that connect to at least one internal node. Internal paths
are shown in pale red.

Show sub paths — display paths between sub nodes. Sub paths are shown in very pale red.

Show invalid paths — display all paths whose actual lengths exceeds their computed minimum
length. Invalid paths are shown in dark red.

Show polygon paths — display all paths that are part of the network of active paths and
polygons. Polygon paths are shown in black.

Show conditioned paths — display paths that have conditions applied. Conditioned paths are
shown in orange.

Show path indices — display the index of each visible path at its midpoint

Show path length — display the minimum length of each visible path

Show path flags — display single-letter codes for the flags attached to each path, which are:

   t — terminal path: the path runs between two terminal nodes.

   v — valid path: this path’s actual length is greater than or equal to its minimum length

   a — active path: this path’s actual length is exactly equal to its minimum length
