    Build Polygons                     14
 Build all of the polygons in the crease pattern. This command constucts polys from active  and
 border paths; it also computes all the reduced paths and reduced polygons, according to the
 theory of the “universal molecule” construction. (The algorithm that does this is one of the
 centerpieces of my origami design theory.) Figure 4.5.17 shows a typical before and after for this
 command.


                                       4.5.17

In the example above, the triangles are converted to triangle polygons, while the irregular
pentagon at the bottom contains a set nested subpolygons.
   Fracture PolyÉ                       1;
 Any active polygon can be broken up into smaller active polygons by adding a stub to the
 corresponding subtree (this is a generalization of Toshiyuki Meguro’s overlapping circle
 algorithm). If you add the stub to an existing node and optimize it using the Optimize Selection
 command, you can usually only break the polygon into three smaller polys. However, if one adds
 the degree of freedom to create a new node along an edge, then it’s possible to break the poly
 into four smaller polys. (This is also a new algorithm I developed.) This command implements
 this improved algorithm.

 You must select a major polygon to fracture, then select this command. A dialog is put up as
 shown in figure 4.5.18.
