It is possible to narrow flaps by adding
new nodes to the tree and inflating them                  5                 4
to break up the active polygon. For
example, in the tree shown above, if you                     4        3
add a point to node 3, as shown in figure                    1.000    1.000

and then, making sure both the new edge                               5
                          Optimize                             8

Selection. This will expand the new edge 7                 1.0009
to its limit, creating new active paths that  6
effectively break up the hexagon into          1.000  2
smaller active polygons â€” in this case,
two triangles and two quadrilaterals, as
shown in figure 3.1.5.                        1        7
