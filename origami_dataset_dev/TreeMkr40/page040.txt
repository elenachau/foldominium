 Now any time we add a new node, it brings with it a node circle that cannot overlap any other
 node circle. In the current configuration, there is no room between node circles 1 and 3 to add a
 new circle. So we will have to add a new node and re-optimize in order to make room for the
 new node. This is a very important point: there is no way to modify the original configuration of
 nodes to make a plan view base without rearranging the entire pattern of nodes!

So, we’ll add a new node attached to
node 3. We’ll want the node to be located                 1
on the centerline between nodes 6 and 7.
We’ll make this forcing using conditions.

There are a couple of ways we could do  4                                   5
it: we could apply a Node fixed to                        1.000
                                                 3                 4
symmetry line and Node fixed to edge             1.000             1.000
condition to the same node; but since we                   2
know exactly where the node should lie,
we can just use a Node fixed to position
condition. So, create a new node attached
to node 3 as shown in figure 3.2.3.                       2
                                                           1.000
Then double-click on the node to bring
up the Node Editor. Apply a Node fixed
to position condition, affixing the node                   3
