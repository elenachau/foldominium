Now we will add side branches to the
tree. Click once on node 2 to select it,
then click once to the left of node 2; this
adds a leg. Click again on node 2 to
select it and click once to the right of
node 2; this adds another leg, as shown in
figure 2.1.4.

Got the hang of it? Now try to add two
more legs to node 3, so that you wind up
with something that looks like figure
2.1.5.

This stick figure represents an animal
with a head, two front legs, a body, two
rear legs, and a tail. It will be used to
define a base with flaps for the head,
legs, body, and tail. Since all of the edges
of the stick figure have the same relative
length, each of the flaps of the base (and
the body) will be the same length in this              2.1.4
example.

Note that the nodes are outlined by lines.
These lines are called border paths;
they’ll define the usable region of the
square when we’re done.
