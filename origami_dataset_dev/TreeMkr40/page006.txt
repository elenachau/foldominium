    1.2  Installing TreeMaker

 To install TreeMaker, drag the “TreeMaker ƒ” folder onto your hard disk. TreeMaker is a fat
 binary Macintosh application and will run native on both 68K and Power Macintosh. (I have no
 plans to port TreeMaker to other platforms. I am told there is a Mac emulator for Linux,
DOS/Win95, and OS/2 called Executor. There is a sample version of it on http://www.ardi.com.)

Much of the information in TreeMaker is color-coded; although you can run it on a gray-scale
system, it will be easier if you have a color monitor with at least 256 colors.

Although you can jump right into TreeMaker if you like to experiment (or you’re the type who
never reads manuals), I recommend that you work your way through the following tutorials to
familiarize yourself with the capabilities of TreeMaker. A basic familiarity with Macintosh
applications is assumed throughout.
