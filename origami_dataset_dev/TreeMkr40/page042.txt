The new node — node 8 — is now on
the bottom of the square. The darker blue                 1
of its edge tells you that it isn’t pinned.      2                 2

menu. This will expand the edge to its           3                 4
maximum possible length.                         1.000             1.000

So now we have nodes 1 and 8 at the top
                                        2                                   2
and bottom of the symmetry line — but
there is still no active path between them.

The reason is that the distance between                    1.000
nodes 1 and 8 is larger than the minimum 3                                  3
allowed path length between them. To
get active paths in place, we need to add                  3
another node to the symmetry line                5        7        6

this excess length. The longer the new
node, the more excess length it will
require. For this new node, we don’t                   3.2.6
know how large it must be, so we’ll use
the Optimize Selection command to
optimize its size. Add a new node                         1
connected to node 3 and apply a Stick to
symmetry line condition (which by now,
you know how to do). The result is
                                        4                 1                 5

Then select both the node and edge and           1.000             1.000
select Optimize Selection from the                         2
Action menu to optimize the position of
the node and the length of the edge.
