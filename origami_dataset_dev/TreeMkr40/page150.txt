 (2) for every path pij  between adjacent nodes ui  and u j ,

                                       u ⋅ u
                                    h ≤
                                       u ⋅ r

                                     ≡   −
                                   u   ui u j
                                     ≡   −

 Although this problem is a nonlinear constrained optimization, since there is only one variable, it

 can be solved directly by simply solving for each equality for all possible paths pij  and taking the
 smallest positive value of h found. The second relation (2) gives the value for h simply by
 replacing the inequality by equality. The solution for equality for relation (1), which is simply a
 quadratic equation in h, is given by the following sequential substitutions:

                                  = ς + ς
                                w    i  j
                                a = r ⋅ r − w2
                                  =  ⋅ +
                                b  u r  lijw
                                  =  ⋅ − 2
                                c  u u  lij
                                   −b +  b2 − ac
                                h =
                                         a
 Obviously, negative or complex values of h should be ignored.
                                                        ′                  ′
 Once a solution is found, we create a set of new reduced nodes ui  and reduced paths pij  of
       ′
length lij

                                    ′ =  +
                                   ui ui  hri

                                 ′ =  −  ς + ς
                                lij lij h()i j
 The reduced nodes and reduced paths are checked for active status and then subdivided into
 polygons, and the process is repeated.
