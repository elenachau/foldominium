Most of the Condition Editor is filled with a scrolling list of all conditions. The “Add…” popup
menu lets you add conditions to the origami design. When you first create a condition, it has
blank fields, which you must fill in with the indices of affected parts and any settings that apply
to those parts.

If you click on or in a condition, it will be highlighted (the third from the bottom is currently
highlighted). If you then click on the “Remove” button, the highlighted condition will be deleted.

If you click on the “Remove All” button, all conditions will be deleted.

Conditions can be applied to nodes, edges, and paths. The Node Editor, Edge Editor, and Path
Editor each contain a reduced version of the Condition Editor that will display only the
conditions that apply to the particular node, edge, or path being edited.

The types of conditions that can be applied and their fields are the following:
