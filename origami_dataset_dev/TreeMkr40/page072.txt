A node is always identified by an index (node 1 in this example). The fields of the Node Editor
are:

x= ___, y= ___ — the coordinates of the node

label — an optional label for the node, which you may use any way you wish

The large list (empty in the example), the popup menu labeled “Add…”, and the two buttons
titled “Remove” and “Remove All” are used to place conditions on the node. See Edit
Conditions… command, Conditions menu, for a description of these tools (which work the
same in every dialog in which they appear).

If you click on the disclosure triangle at the lower left corner of the dialog, it toggles between a
standard dialog and an Expert Mode dialog shown in figure 4.4.2.
