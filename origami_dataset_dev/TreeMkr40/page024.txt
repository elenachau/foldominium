 with the polygon. You’ll have to rebuild the polygons yourself, which you can do by selecting
 the Build Polys and Creases command from the Action menu. Then put the model back into
 Creases Only view (View menu).

The new crease pattern, shown in figure
2.2.16, is mirror-symmetric about the                    6        2         1
new symmetry line and is completely
different from the crease pattern that has

Also, if you check the scale (at the top of
the window), you’ll see that the scale has                 2
fallen once again to 0.2626. So the          3                     6
diagonal symmetry in this example is                                1.000

general, you can orient a model along   4
either symmetry line and will have very          3
