          User Interface Classes

 The user interface of TreeMaker is implemented by a collection of PowerPlant object
 descendants. In the following description, PowerPlant classes are in boldface type.

             Application

 The TreeApp is the application object that maintains interaction with the operating system, puts
up and controls the menu bar, and dispatches commands and clicks to control objects.
