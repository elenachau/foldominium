But how long should we make edge 1?
TreeMaker will find that out for you.   4                                   5

   otherwise, nothing happens because   6                                   7
   TreeMaker simply ignores pinned
   nodes and edges. If you want all
   unpinned nodes and unpinned                        2.3.12
   edges to be considered, just hit
   command-A (Select All) to select
   everything; TreeMaker will weed out the pinned nodes and edges before running the
   optimization.

Look closely at the length of edge 1: its length is “0.600+1.3%”. It is said to be strained. Strain is
a deviation of an edge from its original desired value.

Strain is an important concept, particularly when we start imposing lots of symmetry conditions
on a base. A strained edge behaves as if it were actually longer or shorter. However, an edge
“remembers” its original (“unstrained”) length, a behavior that we utilize elsewhere.

There are two strain-related commands in the Action menu: Remove strain sets all strain to
zero; it undoes any strain changes. Relieve strain does something quite different: it absorbs
length changes due to strain into the edge and resets the strain to zero. Select Relieve strain now.
You’ll see that the length of edge 1 has now changed from 0.6 to 0.608.
