There are no editable fields of a vertex and you canâ€™t apply conditions to one, so the only thing
the Vertex Editor tells you ins the index of the vertex.

However, the disclosure triangle toggles to Expert Mode, which shows some of the structural
information of the vertex, as shown in figure 4.4.10.
