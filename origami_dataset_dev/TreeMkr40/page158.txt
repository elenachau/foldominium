 TreeDoc is the document object that is “command central” — menu selections, keystrokes, and
 mouse actions are routed to the TreeDoc, which places the appropriate calls to the Tree object
 (which is a member variable of the TreeDoc).

 The bulk of TreeMaker consists of various LView subclasses that let the user see and manipulate
 the tree object. The main view is the TreeView object, which displays the tree, the various
 parts, and the crease pattern. By selectively choosing which parts to display, the user can choose
 to view the tree, the crease pattern, or a combination of the two.

 There is also a group of editors which allow you to examine or manipulate the fields of
 individual objects. These are all inherited from the PowerPlant class LModalDialog and a
utility class, PartEditorMixin, which supplies useful routines for displaying object
addresses as indices.

A second group of editors perform small manipulations on the tree, e.g., changing the paper size,
setting the lengths of a group of edges, and so forth.

The ConditionRegistry class provides a binding between Condition objects and the
views used to reference them.

The ConditionTool<P, C> class provides tools for creating and filtering Conditions for
Parts and lists of Parts.
