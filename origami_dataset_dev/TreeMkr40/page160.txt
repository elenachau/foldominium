             Miscellaneous

 I also found it necessary to write a number of small utility packages or modified classes. They
 are:

 Alerts - a wrapper to handle simple alerts

 AnimatedCursor - displays a cursor animation during calculations

 LCropMark - a pane that displays crop marks in a printout

 LFloatEditField - an edit field that displays a floating-point value

 LGACaptEditField - an edit field that turns into a LCaption when it is disabled

 LGADeadCheckbox (obsolete) - a checkbox that doesn’t respond to clicks. It’s a convenient
 tool for displaying binary information

 LGAModalDialogBox - a dialog box (derived from LGADialogBox) that displays true
 modal dialog behavior (disabling all commands when it’s in the foreground).

 LGATargetAnnouncingEditField - an edit field that broadcasts a message when it
 becomes the target.

 QDUtils - routines for doing arithmetic with QuickDraw Point records

 ToggleSizeDialog - a dialog box that has two sizes you can toggle between. I use it to hide
 object data fields that aren’t used directly but keeps them accessible.

 UParamText - a utility that does for PowerPlant views what the system routine
 ::ParamText() does for resource-based dialogs and alerts.

 UPlaceDialog - a utility that places dialogs in the right place on the main screen

 Sort - a template class for sorting an array of numbers.

    7.2  Tree Classes: Details

 In this section the fundamental data structures are discussed along with their inheritance
 hierarchy. Many objects inherit from a “Owner” class; as discussed below, an “ObjectOwner”
 maintains a list of references to “Object” and when the “Owner” is deleted, it kills all of its
 owned objects.

 The relationships between objects are maintained by references and lists of references. These are
 summarized in the table below. Bolded names are references that are inherited from subclasses.

       Part-ness

 Most objects inherit from a base class called Part which has two member variables: an index,
which is set by the owner of the part, and a pointer to the top-level Tree structure.
 class Part
