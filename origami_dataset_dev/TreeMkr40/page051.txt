 All bases designed by TreeMaker are what I call a “uniaxial” base. A uniaxial base is one in
 which all the flaps lie along a single line. A base in which all of the flaps are edge flaps has the
 very useful property that the layers can be arranged so that with all of the layers in the same half-
 plane, no major flap is enclosed inside of another flap. I call a base with this latter property a
 “simple” uniaxial base. Simple bases can also be designed by the “string-of-beads” algorithm,
 and it is fairly easy to prove that the perimeter of an edge-flap-only base cannot exceed the
 perimeter of the square.

 It is tempting to suppose that any simply stacked base must be an edge-flap-only base, but it is
 often possible to add auxiliary nodes to a base with middle points to make them “quasi-edge-
 like”. An example will make this clear.

An eight-pointed base in which all of the
flaps are edge flaps is shown in figure
3.3.7. It has a scale of 0.250. If we don’t
force all the points to be edge flaps, we’ll
find the arrangement shown in figure
3.3.8, in which four of the points have
become middle flaps.
