There are no editable fields of a crease and you can’t apply conditions to one. However, the
Crease Editor does tell you the index and the type of crease (mountain, valley, or tristate).

The disclosure triangle toggles to Expert Mode, which shows some of the structural information
about the crease, as shown in figure 4.4.12.

These editors are brought up by double-clicking on a visible part, but they can also be called up
for any part (visible or invisible) by selecting the Edit Part… command, Edit menu (see below).
