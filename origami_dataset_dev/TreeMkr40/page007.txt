    2.1  Tutorial 1: Designing a Base

 In this tutorial, you will work through the design of a 4-legged animal with a head and tail and
 will learn the fundamentals of designing a model with TreeMaker. Before starting it, you should
 understand the fundamentals of origami design, such as the difference between corner, edge, and
 middle flaps and be familiar with the basic origami procedures and terms such as valley fold,
 mountain fold, reverse fold, rabbit ear, et cetera.

 Begin by double-clicking on the TreeMaker icon to launch it. On startup, TreeMaker creates a
 new, untitled window that displays a square — the default shape of paper. Later, you will see
 how to change the size and shape of the paper (you can even design for a rectangle if you like)
 but for now we’ll use a square.

 TreeMaker designs an origami base that can be represented by a stick figure. You specify the
 desired proportions of your base by drawing a stick figure in the square and specifying its
 dimensions. If you have ever used a drawing program on a Macintosh computer, you should have
 no trouble in figuring out how to draw a figure, but if you haven’t, we’ll walk you through it.

Click once in the middle of the square.
You will see a dot appear with a number
above it. This dot is a node; the number
is the index of the node, which is used to
identify the node later on. Each node is
assigned a unique index. You can ignore
the index for now. If you clicked just
once, the node has a highlight around it,
which means that it is selected. If the
node has no highlight, it is deselected.
The color of the highlight is the color set
on your computer, so it may be different
from the orange color shown in figure
2.1.1.
