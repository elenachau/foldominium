    2.3  Tutorial 3: Changing edge lengths

 In this tutorial, you will work through the design of a base that could be used for a human figure.
 In the process, you will learn how to change the lengths of flaps.

If you have quit TreeMaker, start it up
again or select New from the File menu
to create a new square. We will be                        1

shown in figure 2.3.1.

Initially, all of the edges of the tree graph
have the same length, which is defined to
                                                          2
be 1 unit. The length of the edge is                      1.000
written near the middle of the edge. For
many designs, it is desirable to change
the lengths of some of the edges to make
them longer or shorter than other edges.                  3
For example, if you were making a                  5             6
                                                   1.000          1.000
grasshopper, you’d want the back legs to    6                            7
be much longer than the front legs. In
TreeMaker, you can choose the length of
any flap. That’s what we’ll learn how to
do now.                                                2.3.1
Each edge of the tree has a set of
attributes, one of which is its length. To change the length of the “head” (i.e., edge number 1),
double-click on it. A dialog box will appear as shown in figure 2.3.2.
