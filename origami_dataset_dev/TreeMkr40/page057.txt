Building the creases gives a distorted
Bird Base–like shape shown in figure
3.4.9 whose flaps remain the proper
length for the specified tree.

If instead we had chosen to make the
stub on edge 1, we would have achieved
the crease pattern shown in figure 3.4.10.

Both crease patterns result in the 4 initial
flaps coming out with the same length
and scale. In both cases, there is an extra
flap that corresponds to the stub. The
extra flap “soaks up” excess paper within
the polygon.
