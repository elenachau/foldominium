Crease

A Crease is a line in the crease pattern. There are three types of Creases: ValleyCrease,
MountainCrease, and TristateCrease. The Crease inherits only from Part

                             Part        Crease

The references contained by a Crease are summarized below. Names in bold refer to inherited
member variables.

Crease   mVertices           2 vertices at each end of the crease

Condition

A Condition is a relationship between portions of the tree to implement symmetry, fixed
angles, and other constraints on the crease pattern.

Condition is a base class that defines the behavior for all possible conditions, which may
establish and enforce relationships any other part of the tree. Before an optimization is
performed, all Conditions associated with a Tree are polled and are allowed to apply
mathematical constraints (equalities and inequalities) that enforce the condition.

At present, there are 10 types of Condition on Nodes, Edges, and Paths.
