 blue) and selecting this command, the lengths of all of the unpinned selected edges will be
 lengthened proportionally by increasing their strain, optimizing the position of the unpinned
 selected nodes. If you happen to have selected pinned nodes or edges, they will be ignored. Since
 only the selected nodes and edges will be considered, an easy way to increase all possible nodes
 and edges is to select all (command-A) and then select this command. Figure 4.5.14 shows a
 typical before and after configuration for scaling a single edge.

   Split Selected EdgeÉ                1H
 This command lets you add a node somewhere in the middle of an existing edge. Selecting this
 comands puts up a dialog shown in figure 4.5.15.


                                       4.5.15

You enter the distance the soon-to-be-created node should be from the indicated node (in tree
units). You must enter a positive value less than the length of the edge. A new node will be
added along the edge, breaking it into two separate edges. Just adding a node to an edge doesn’t
accomplish anything, but you can use the new node to add new branches to the tree. Figure
4.5.16 shows a before and after configuration.
