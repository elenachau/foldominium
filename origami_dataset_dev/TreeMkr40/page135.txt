Figure 5.26. In a triangle, all three corners are inset to the same point, which is the intersection
of the angle bisectors. This gives the rabbit ear molecule.


Figure 5.27. The four possible universal molecules for a quad. If all four corners are inset to the
same point, the result is the Husimi molecule (top left). If adjacent pairs of corners are inset to
two points, the Maekawa molecule is obtained (top right). If the inset polygon is a triangle, it is
filled in with a rabbit ear molecule, which also results in a Maekawa molecule (bottom left).
Finally, if the inset polygon is a quad crossed by an active reduced path, the result is the gusset
quad.
These examples are just the tip of the iceberg; beyond four sides, the possibilities rapidly
explode. But this explosion doesn’t matter; there is a unique universal molecule for every
possible active polygon that satisfies the tree theorem.

An alternative design approach that blends aspects of the circle method and tree methods has
been described by Kawahata2 and Maekawa3. It has been called this the “string-of-beads”
