    4.3  Creating a new Tree

 When a window is first opened, it will be in Default View showing a blank square, as shown in
 figure 4.3.1.

You define the tree by pointing and
clicking in the square to draw a stick
figure that defines the topology of the
desired origami base. Clicking once in
the square produces a node at the
location of the click, as shown in figure
4.3.3. When a node is selected it is
highlighted: it has a spot of color around
it in the highlight color of the computer
TreeMaker is running on.

If a single node is highlighted, clicking in
another location will add a node with an
edge connecting the two, as shown in
figure 4.3.3.
