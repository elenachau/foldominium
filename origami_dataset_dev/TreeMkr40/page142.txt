and lengths of points to the near-exclusion of other folding considerations such as line, form, and
character. With algorithmic origami design, point count comes automatically and is no longer the
overwhelming consideration in technical origami design. In the past, origami art and origami
science have often been at odds, but with algorithmic origami design, the technical designer,
freed from the need to expend his or her energies on the number of appendages, can focus on the
art of folding, secure in the knowledge that the science will take care of itself.
