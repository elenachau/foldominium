If you built creases to make your paper
look like figure 2.2.3, select Remove                      1
Polygons from the Action menu and                2
 make sure you are in Default View (in                             2

 the View menu). You’ll see that the                       1.000
 paper now has a green line, which               3
                                                                            5
                                                  1.000            4
 indicates the line of symmetry as shown                   2
 in figure 2.2.6.                                                   1.000

 Now we need to establish a relationship
                                                           2          2
 between individual nodes and the line of                  1.000
 symmetry. A node can have one of two
 possible relationships with the line of                   3
 symmetry: it actually lie on the line of 3
                                                                 3
 symmetry (for example, the head or tail
 of an animal) or it can be one of a pair of     5         6
 nodes arranged symmetrically about the          1.000     1.000
 line of symmetry. In our model, the head 6       3         7
 lies on the symmetry line of the tree.
 Thus, we need to force the node that
 corresponds to the head (node 7) to lie on            2.2.6
 the symmetry line of the square.

 When we want to impose additional requirements on a tree, we are imposing conditions on the
 various parts of the tree. We can impose conditions in several ways. The easiest is to simply
 select node 1, and from the Conditions menu, select the command Node fixed to symmetry
 line.

 What we have done is impose a
condition on node 1. The tangible                          1
evidence of this is that the circle around       2
node 1 has turned green, as shown in                               2

figure 2.2.7. Also, if you click on the                    1.000
Conditions menu, you’ll see that the             3
                                                                            5
Node fixed to symmetry line                       1.000            4
                          command                          2
is now checked. (Don’t select the                                   1.000
command again, or you’ll toggle off this 2
condition.)
                                                           2          2
                                                           1.000
   •Note that node 1 hasn’t moved and
   isn’t on the symmetry line;                             3
   conditions don’t take effect until   3
                                                                 3
   you perform another optimization.

Next, we need to tell TreeMaker that             1.000     1.000
pairs of flaps should be mirror-
                                        6         3         7
symmetric. For example, nodes 4 and 5
correspond to the left and right arms of
the figure. Thus, each of nodes 4 and 5                2.2.7
should be the mirror image of the other.
