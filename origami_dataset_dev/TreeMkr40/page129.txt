 Figure 5.20. (Left) Tree with a new terminal node. (Right) One possible position for node G that
 satisfies the tree theorem.
 Figure 5.20 shows the circles around each node. As long as the circles do not overlap, the tree
 theorem is satisfied. As l, the length of the new edge, is increased, the size of the circle around
 node G must be increased as well. Eventually, circle G will swell until it is touching at least three
 other circles, and at that point, shown in figure 5.21, the new point is as large as it can possibly
 be.

Figure 5.21. Terminal node pattern with the largest possible circle around node G.
Wherever circle G touches another circle, the two terminal nodes are spaced at their minimum
 separation. Consequently, the paths between the nodes of touching circles are active paths.
