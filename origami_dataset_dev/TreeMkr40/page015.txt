That’s all for this example. You have learned the basics of TreeMaker: how to define a stick
figure using the point-and-click interface and how to construct a basic crease pattern. In the next
example, you’ll learn how to modify the stick figure to alter proportions, how to incorporate
symmetry, and how to customize the screen and printed image.

   2.2   Tutorial 2: Imposing symmetry

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use some more of the settings in TreeMaker and how to
incorporate bilateral symmetry into your design.
