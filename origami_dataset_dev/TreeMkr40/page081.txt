    Select All                         1A
 This command selects all visible nodes and edges. It’s most useful for deleting everything and
 starting over and, with operations that are constrained to the selection (like Optimize Edges and
 Fracture Poly), for giving the largest number of degrees of freedom possible.
    Edit PartÉ                          1I
 This command puts up a dialog, the Part Selector, that lets you select a part to edit by several
 different criteria. This is useful if several parts are close together and you can’t easily click on the
 one you want.


                                       4.5.2

The fields of the Part Selector are:

Path by nodes — specifies a path according to the indices of the nodes at each end of the path

Node by index — specifies a node according to its index

Edge by index — specifies an edge according to its index

Path by index — specifies a path according to its index

Poly by index — specifies a poly according to its index

Vertex by index — specifies a vertex according to its index

Crease by index — specifies a crease according to its index

This command is used to edit a node, edge, path, poly, vertex, or crease when you can’t easily
double-click on it. I find that I use it most often to get access to a particular path when I know the
nodes at each end of the path, so that’s the default selection criterion.

After you close this dialog, an editor will be put up for the selected part.
