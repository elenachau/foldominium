 — the index of the second node
 Nodes collinear

                                       4.5.34

This condition is used to force three nodes to be collinear. It’s used to make crease patterns more
symmetric. The fields are:

— the index of the first node

— the index of the second node

— the index of the third node

Note: a more effective way of making a crease pattern symmetric is to use the “Path Angle
Fixed/Quantized” conditions.
Edge length fixed

                                       4.5.35

This condition is used to force an edge to have zero strain in a strain optimization. The fields are:

— the index of the edge
Edges same strain

                                       4.5.36

This condition is used to force two edges to have the same strain in a strain optimization. The
fields are:

— the index of the first edge

— the index of the second edge

Note: you can force a group of edges to all have the same strain by binding each edge in the
group to a common edge with this condition.
