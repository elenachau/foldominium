The origami design is complete!
   Remove Creases                      1R
 Removes all creases from the image.
    Build Polys & Creases              16
 Builds both polygons and creases in a single step.

    Conditions
 The Conditions menu contains commands for applying or removing conditions from the origami
 design. A condition is a way of imposing additional requirements on the crease pattern beyond
 the bare minimum required for foldability. For example, you might want to require that the
 crease pattern be bilaterally symmetric (to match the subject), that certain flaps be corner or edge
 flaps (to minimize the total thickness of the flap); that certain flaps be the same length no matter
 how the tree is distorted due to strain; or that certain paths fall at particularly symmetric angles.
 The requirements are met by creating objects called “conditions” and linking them to the tree.
    Edit ConditionsÉ                   1=
 The Edit Conditions… command puts up a dialog that displays all conditions and their settings,
as shown in figure 4.5.28.
