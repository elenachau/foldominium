Open the TreeMaker application if it is
not already open and create a new
square. Make a five-limbed stick figure                  1
as shown in figure 2.2.1. As you did in
the previous tutorial, set the body                     1
segment to have a length of 0.8, but this                1.000
                                           4                          5

time weâ€™ll leave the head to have a length               2
of 1.                                             1.000         1.000

Now select Optimize Scale from the

Action menu to optimize the distribution                 1.000
of nodes. You should see the nodes move
around as usual, and then suddenly the
two bottom nodes will shift over toward                  3
one side or the other. When the                  5             6

optimization stops, the pattern of nodes          1.000              7
will be asymmetric, as shown in figure    6
2.2.2.
