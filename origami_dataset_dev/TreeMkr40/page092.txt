  Absorb Selected Node                1K
Nodes that have exactly two branches are unnecessary and are called “redundant” nodes. (the
node added by the previous command is a redundant node, at least until you attach something to
it.) If you select a redundant node, this command absorbs it into the edges it connects and joins
the edges into a single edge. This is the inverse of Split Selected Edge.
   Absorb Redundant Nodes              1-
This command absorbs all redundant nodes in the tree. It’s useful for cleaning up a tree if you
fractured one or more polys and then subsequently deleted all of the stubs.
   Remove Strain                       1]
This command sets the strain of all edges to zero while leaving their lengths unchanged.
   Relieve Strain                      1[
This command changes the lengths of the edges to be equal to their strained length and then sets
the strain equal to zero.
   Minimize Strain                    13
This command does another optimization that minimizes the RMS strain of the node
configuration. This is the command to use when many path active conditions have been placed
on the nodes, particularly if they are coupled with quantized angles; often it is not possible to
satisfy all conditions without straining different edges by different amounts.

Note: it is very easy to set up conditions that admit no solution at all. A sign that you have done
this is that the optimizer will suddenly set the scale nearly equal to zero.
