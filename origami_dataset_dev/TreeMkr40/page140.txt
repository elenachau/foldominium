fold up in the base (I encourage you to try). The flaps are, as you might expect, much wider than
they are long. However, by sinking the top of the base in and each, all of the flaps can be thinned
to arbitrarily large aspect ratio while maintaining their relative lengths.


Figure 5.34. Universal molecule version of the Oru tree
All of the crease patterns in figures 5.31â€“5.34 share the property that all points lie on the edge of
the square. If we relax this constraint and allow middle points, then we can achieve a slightly
larger and even simpler pattern (with a scale of 0.067 as compared to 0.065 for the previous
pattern), shown in figure 5.35.
