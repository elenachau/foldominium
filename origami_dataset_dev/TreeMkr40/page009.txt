 • Double-click on a node or edge to edit its individual characteristics (we’ll get into this later)

 By clicking and dragging, you can change the position of a node or edge. As you build up
 constraints on the position of a node, a node can become “pinned” and you won’t be able to drag
 it around any more. However, if you hold down the option key, you can override this behavior
 and drag a pinned node.

 To delete a node or edge, you can either hit the backspace key or select Clear from the Edit
 menu. Although you can’t drag a pinned node without holding down the option key, you can
 delete any node at any time.

 Keyboard commands for editing are:

 • <delete> or <forward delete> to delete selected nodes or edges

 • <tab> to deselect everything

 • Command-A to select everything

 Deleting a terminal node also removes the attached edge. Similarly, deleting an edge also deletes
 any nodes that would otherwise be orphaned.

 • Note: you can’t delete a node or edge if it would break the tree into two pieces. You’ll get an
 error message if you try.

Now we will build a tree. Choose Select
All from the Edit menu and then choose
Clear from the Edit menu (or hit
<delete>) to get rid of what’s currently
on the square. Now, starting near the
bottom of the square, click once to place
a node; then click once about 1/3 of the
way up; click once again about 2/3 of the
way up; and click once near the top of
the square. You will have created a line
of four nodes and three edges as shown
in figure 2.1.3.

This line of nodes represents the head
(top), body (middle) and tail (bottom) of
the animal. Note that only terminal nodes
get circles around them.
