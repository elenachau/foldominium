 The top of the window shows the scale of the current design (the scale is the relationship
between one edge unit and the size of the square). The rest of the window shows all the parts.

The collection of nodes and edges is known as a tree. Lines between nodes are paths. There is a
path between most pairs of nodes, however, most paths are invisible in the windows above.
Groups of certain paths form polys (“poly” is short for “polygon” and I’ll use the term more or
less interchangeably). Polys are filled in with vertices and creases. The vertices and creases form
the crease pattern for the origami base. The design of an origami base is accomplished in three
steps:

(1) Construction of a tree and specification of the desired attributes of the base (this is done by
you)

(2) Placement of the nodes in a valid configuration (this is computed by TreeMaker)

(3) Construction of the polys, vertices, and creases, forming the crease pattern for the base. (This
is also computed by TreeMaker.)

Figure 4.2.33 shows a finished crease pattern.
