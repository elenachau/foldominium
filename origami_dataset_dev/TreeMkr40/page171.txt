• Dialogs no longer alter parts directly; instead, they issue commands to the TreeDoc together
with a list of the new settings. (This is in preparation for implementing Undo/Redo by
bottlenecking all editing actions through the TreeDoc.)

• In dialogs, eliminated unnecessary ctor/dtor method declarations and inlined from-LStream
ctors.

• Private data shown in part editors was made less obtrusive (smaller type)

• All part indices are now fully validated in dialogs

• Validation alerts are provided by a new superclass for all dialogs, class TreeDialog. Text in
validation alerts is now stored in an ‘STR#’ resource (per Mac UI guidelines).

• Fixed bug in which menus were not updated properly after a Tab or Delete keystroke.

• Optimize Selected Nodes… command and StretchyEdgeOptimizer have been modified so that
the only nodes and edges considered for scaling are those in the current selection.

• Many new commands and optimizers added to Action Menu:

• Added Split Edge… command which lets you add a node to the middle of an edge

• Added Absorb Node command which lets you remove a redundant node from the middle of an
edge

• Added Absorb Redundant Nodes command, which removes all redundant nodes

• Added Arrange Internal Nodes command, which cleans up the position of internal nodes.

• Added Fracture Poly… command, which lets you add a node inside a polygon that forms four
active paths with the polygon nodes, effectively fracturing the polygon into smaller polys.

• Added Triangulate Tree command, which fractures all polys in the crease pattern down to
order-3 polys.

• Fixed memory leak in ConstrainedMinimax (constraints were not being destroyed)

• Restored computation of tristate creases for rabbit-ear molecules in Build Creases.

• Updated documentation and added tutorials to describe the new commands.

• “Wait” cursor is now in color.

• Improved About… box.
(3.6) 03-18-96 released

• Added “Show Creases and Circles” command, which is a useful view for printing.
