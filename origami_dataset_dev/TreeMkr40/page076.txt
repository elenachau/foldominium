      Polys

If you double-click on a poly, the Poly Editor is put up, as shown in figure 4.4.7.

There are no editable fields of a poly and you canâ€™t apply conditions to one, so the only thing the
Poly Editor really tells you is the index of the poly.

However, the disclosure triangle toggles to Expert Mode, which gives some of the structural
information of the poly, as shown in figure 4.4.8. A poly is, internally, a fairly complex beastie.
