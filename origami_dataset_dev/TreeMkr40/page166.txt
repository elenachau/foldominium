Poly

A Poly is a polygon of the crease pattern. The paper is divided into one or more polygons; each
polygon may be further subdivided into one or more reduced polygons. Each polygon owns
reduced nodes, reduced paths, and creases.

Poly     mOwnedNodes         All nodes owned by this poly; this is the distinct
                             subset of mInsetNodes; i.e., every node in
                             mInsetNodes appears exactly once in this list.
