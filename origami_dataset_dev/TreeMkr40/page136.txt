approach to design. As in the tree method, you begin with a tree graph of the model to be folded.
Each line of the graph is doubled and the graph is expanded to fill a square, with the nodes of the
graph spaced around the edges of the square like beads on a string. The process is illustrated for a
six-flap based in figure 5.28.


Figure 5.28. The string-of-beads design method. The tree graph is turned into a closed polygon,
which is then “inflated” inside of a square with straight lines between the terminal nodes. The
result is a large polygon inside the square that is collapsed into the base.
In the string-of-beads method, the tree graph is converted into a large polygon in which each
corner is one of the terminal nodes of the tree and each side is as long as the path between
adjacent terminal nodes. It is clear that this distribution of terminal nodes is just a special case of
the tree method in which we have constrained all of the nodes to lie on the edge of the square; it
avoids having middle points, but at the expense of possibly reduced efficiency.

The string-of-beads approach produces a large polygon that must be collapsed into the base, and
the techniques described by Maekawa involve placing tangent circles in the contours shown in
the last step of figure 5.28 (which is analogous to our use of additional circles to break down
active polygons into smaller polygons in the tree method; Kawahata’s algorithm projects
hyperbolas in from the edges to locate reference points for molecular patterns.) However, one
can also apply the universal molecule directly to the string-of-beads polygon, achieving another
efficient crease pattern that collapses it into a base.
