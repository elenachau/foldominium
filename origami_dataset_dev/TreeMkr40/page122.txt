subbase have the same lengths as the three edges of the tree.
If you are actually folding the active polygon, you can find the intersection of the angle bisectors
— point E in the figure — just by pinching each corner in half along the bisector and finding the
 point where all the creases come together. If you are calculating the crease locations numerically,
 there is a beautiful formula for the location of the intersection of the angle bisectors of an
 arbitrary triangle. If pA, pB, and pC are the vector coordinates of corners A, B, and C and pE is
the coordinate of the bisector intersection, then pE is given by the simple formula

                            p (b + c) + p (c + a) + p (a + b)
                        p  =  A        B        C      .
                         E           2(a + b + c)

That is, the location of the bisector intersection is simply the average of the coordinates of the
three corners with each corner weighted by the length of the opposite side.

What happens when one of the sides of the triangle is not an active path? This can happen, for
example, when one of the sides of the triangle lies along an edge of the square; all of the triangles
in figure 5.8 are of this type. Since the distance between any two terminal nodes must be greater
than or equal to the minimum path length, the side that isn’t an active path must be slightly too
long to be an active path rather than too short. Fortunately, only a slight modification of the
rabbit ear is necessary to address this situation. Figure 5.11 shows the crease pattern and subbase
when side BC is slightly too long.
