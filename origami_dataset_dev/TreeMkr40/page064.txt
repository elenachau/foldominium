If you’re happy with the results of the
strain optimization, you can make it
permanent by selecting the Relieve                        4
strain command, Action menu. This
absorbs the strain into the length of each       3      3          3
edge and resets the strain to zero, as                   1.014
shown in figure 3.5.10.                 7      6        3        7          8
                                                1.014     3       1.014
You can again Build Polygons and                       2
Creases from the Action menu to get the       3         0.622        3
                                                          2
new crease pattern shown in figure      3               2                   3
3.5.11.                                            2            2
                                                        1
You’ll see that the new crease pattern is 2              1.014              2
somewhat simpler and cleaner than the          4          1      5
previous pattern. Perhaps more useful is        1.014             1.014
that with the standardization of the             2                 2
angles, you can find all of the reference
                                        5                                   6
points by folding alone.
