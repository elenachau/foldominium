We’ll do this second stage now via the
simplest route. Go to the Action menu
and select Build Polygons. You will see
the polygons become inlined with a thick
gray border, as shown in figure 2.1.8.

Then select the command Build Creases.
You will see a bunch of new lines
appear, as shown in figure 2.1.9.

This is the full crease pattern. The black
lines are valley folds; the medium gray
lines are mountain folds. You might
wonder why I don’t use dashed and chain
lines for mountain and valley folds, since
they are standard origami usage. I’ve
found that with the low resolution of
computer screens, in very complex
crease patterns, it’s hard to distinguish
the two.
