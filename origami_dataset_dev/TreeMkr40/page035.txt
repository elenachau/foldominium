This crease pattern gives a single active                                   3
polygon, which is a hexagon. Now, as I                          3

Polys and Creases from the  Action             1.000  2

polygon with the “universal molecule”   2
crease pattern. This is the simplest          1        7

Although the universal molecule is the
simplest pattern, it produces a base with
wide flaps that must be repeatedly sunk                3.1.2
in and out to narrow them.
