Building creases gives the crease pattern
shown in figure 3.1.6.

Alternatively, you could have added the
new edge to node 2, which would give
you the same crease pattern flopped end-
for-end.

With either of these two patterns, you get
a crease pattern in which the “head” and
“tail” are folded differently. For reasons
of symmetry, you might want the head
and tail to be symmetric, in which case,
if you add a new edge, you need to put it
in the middle of edge 2.

A third possibility is to split edge 2,
using the Split selected edge command.
 If you split the edge, add a new node and
 edge, and then optimize the length of the
 new edge, you will get the node                       3.1.6
arrangement shown in figure 3.1.7.
