The process can be repeated essentially
infinitely; you can make the quad smaller                  2
and smaller, but you’ll never get rid of it!
Figure 3.4.5 continues the process, but         1
there is still one quadrilateral.       3
                                                    1
There is a fundamental reason for this         1                  1

                                                  8 1   6
of four active paths. But when you add a          1         1
new edge to an existing node, you only               1
have three degrees of freedom: the x and
y coordinates of the new node and the                                       5
length of the edge. To create four active
paths, you need a fourth degree of
                                                            1
freedom.

If we add the new edge to a newly-
                                        4
created node formed by splitting an edge,
we have a fourth degree of freedom,
namely, the location of the split along the            3.4.5
edge. There is a special command for
adding a node that forms four active
paths by splitting an edge; it is the Fracture Poly… command in the Action menu. This
command lets you break up an active polygon by splitting one of the edges in such a way as to
form four active paths.

To use this command, you need to build
the polygons and select the one to be                      2
fractured. Select the Build Polys
command from the   Action menu, as              1
shown in figure 3.4.6.                  3                   1
                                                             0.600
                                                  2               1
This builds all of the polygons for the            0.400 6
crease pattern. There are two kinds of           7            1
polygons: “top-level” polygons, which   1          10
                                                   2  1
are formed from the nodes of the tree,                 311
                                                             9      4
and “subpolygons,” which are smaller                                 0.800
polygons located inside of the top-level         8
polygons. In the figure, the largest              3                         5
polygon — the quadrilateral — is a top-            1.000
level polygon. The two small triangles
                                                            1
are sub-polygons, which are fully
enclosed by the top-level polygon.
