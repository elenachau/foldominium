 The most common choice is N=8, which corresponds to the angles you find in a Bird Base, but
 there are many other useful possibilities to be found in the other angles, and I have found
 interesting structures for N=10 as well.

 We’ll work with N=8 for now. Type in 8 and click OK.

Note that the node circles have turned
green, indicating that there’s a condition                4
imposed on the nodes (actually, on the           3                 3
paths connected to the nodes). However,                 3

In principle, you should be able to re-                2

TreeMaker’s nolinear optimizer,                         2
TreeMaker has a tendency to settle onto a           2           2
spurious solution in which the entire                   1

To prevent this tendency, we’ll need to        4                 5

stitch some of the nodes to the edges of

The two easiest to do this to are to stick
nodes 5 and 6 to their present locations.
