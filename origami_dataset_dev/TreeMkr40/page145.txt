Note, however, that the last term may or may not be a mixture of fixed and variable parts
depending upon which nodes are moving.

   6.5   Strain Optimization

Strain optimization is used to distort the edges of the tree minimally in order to impose other
global constraints, e.g., symmetry, particular angles, etc, on the overall crease pattern. As with
edge optimization, the overall scale is fixed, but in this case, rather than maximizing the same
strain for all affected edges, the strain optimizer minimizes the RMS strain for a large set of edges
with each edge potentially having a different strain. As with the strain optimizer, there is a set of
strainable edges E s and a set of moving nodes U s . The strain optimizer solves the problem:

            σ 2     σ        ∈  s
         ∑   i     { i ∈ s ,u j U }
 minimize       over  ei E        s.t.
