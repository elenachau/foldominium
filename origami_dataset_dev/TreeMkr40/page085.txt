  Show Creases and Circles            1U
Show the crease pattern plus circles around terminal nodes. This group of settings shows some of
the structure of the base superimposed over the crease pattern. Itâ€™s a good compromise between
showing just the crease pattern but also giving some indication of where paper goes into flaps.
Here is an example shown in figure 4.5.8.
