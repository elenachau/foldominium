When adding the new node to the crease
pattern, we didn’t necessarily have to add                1
it to node 2, which put the extra point          2                 2
between the legs of the base; we could
                                                          1
                                        4                                   5
have added it to node 4, which would put                   1.000
the extra point at the shoulders of the          3        2        4
base. If you do that and run the                  1.000             1.000
                                                            2
optimization, you’ll get the pattern                      98
                                                            1.000-56.8%
shown in figure 3.2.10.                 2                                   2
                                                          2
This gives a different crease pattern,
                                                           2
shown in figure 3.2.11. This crease                         1.000
pattern is entirely different: yet it results
in a plan view base with exactly the same 3                                 3
number and size of flaps as the first                     3

example.

In both cases, the extra flap “sops up”           1.000    0.400+115.8%1.000

excess paper between the top and bottom
of the model. The difference between the
two is that in the first example, the extra        Figure 3.2.10
paper emanates from the junction of the
top group of points. In the second, the
excess flap emanates from the bottom
group of points.

There’s another possibility: we could
collect the excess paper in the middle of
the model. This would be preferable
because it distributes layers more evenly
through the model. We can do this by
adding the new flap in the middle of edge
2.

To do this, delete the new node you just
added. Then select edge 2. Choose the
command Split selected edge… from the
Action menu, which puts up the dialog
shown in figure 3.2.12.
