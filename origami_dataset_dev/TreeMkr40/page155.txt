a Macintosh-specific class library.

         Tree Classes

The Tree Classes are the classes that support a unified mathematical model of the tree (the stick
figure); the crease pattern; and the relationships between the various objects. The figure below
shows the different classes and their inheritance hierarchy.

The primary Tree Classes are:
Tree

Node

Edge

Path

Poly

Vertex

Crease

Condition

All primary classes inherit similar behavior from the Part base class. Some classes have the
capability of owning instances of other classes. Condition is a base class for conditions
imposed on the crease pattern (e.g., bilateral symmetry). A more detailed description of the Tree
classes is given later.
