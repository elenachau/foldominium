The new scale is 0.36367, somewhat
larger; so this configuration is more   4                                   5
efficient than the last. However, it’s not       3                 4
very elegant, because nodes 6 and 7 are           1.000             1.000
close to a corner but are not precisely in                  2
the corner. Option-drag each of those two                 1
nodes into the corner as shown in figure                  1 0.600
2.3.12.                                 2                                   2

   •Note: you can put a node exactly
                                                           2
   into the corner by dragging it                          0.750
   slightly beyond the corner. If you   3                                   3
   drag a node beyond an edge, when
   you let go, TreeMaker will snap the
   node to the nearest edge. Drag it
   beyond a corner and TreeMaker                           3
   will snap it into the corner.                 5                 6
                                                 1.000             1.000
                                        6                                   7
Now select Build Polys and Creases
from the Action menu. Nothing happens.
What’s wrong?                                         2.3.12
TreeMaker cannot build polygons or
creases if there are unpinned, or movable, terminal nodes that are inside what would be a
polygon. What do we mean by pinned? A pinned node is one that cannot be moved in any
direction without either violating a path constraint or going outside the square.

Nodes aren’t the only things that are pinned; an edge whose length cannot be made larger
without causing some path to be violated is also said to be pinned. A pinned edge is shown in a
lighter blue than an unpinned edge (initially, all edges are unpinned). Looking at figure 2.3.12,
you can see that all edges except edge number 1, and all terminal nodes except node 1, are
pinned.

An edge that isn’t pinned can be made longer without reducing the lengths of other edges, which
means that the flap in the base that corresponds to the edge can be made longer. Sometimes
lengthening a flap of the base is esthetically acceptable; sometimes it isn’t. For this example, if
we lengthen the head flap, we’ll just have a bit more paper with which to make hair, facial
features, et cetera. So we can, and will, length edge number 1.
