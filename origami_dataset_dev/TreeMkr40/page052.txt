Although four of the flaps are middle
flaps and will be trapped inside layers,
it’s possible to squash-fold the raw-edged
flaps attached to each node in such a way
that a simply-stacked base is obtained.
And clearly, the perimeter of this base
exceeds the perimeter of the square by
the factor (sec(15°)), or by about 3.5%.

   3.4 Fracturing polygons

Once you have completed an
optimization, the simplest crease pattern
that collapses into a base is produced by
choosing Build Polys and Creases,
which creates all creases using the
“universal molecule” algorithm. You can
also break up high-order active polygons
into lower-order active polygons by
adding new edges to existing nodes.
When you create a new edge and scale it                3.3.8
using Optimize selection, it will be
 expanded until it forms typically three
 new active paths.

 This process will break any polygon of order 5 or higher into polygons of lower order. In
 general, the lower the order of the active polygon, the simpler it is to fold, so this is often a
 desirable process. However, if you try to break up a polygon of order 4 (a quadrilateral), unless it
 happens to have a line of symmetry, you will form two triangles and another quadrilateral. Thus,
 you cannot in general reduce a crease pattern to all triangles simply by adding new edges to
 existing nodes.
