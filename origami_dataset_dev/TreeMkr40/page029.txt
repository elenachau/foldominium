Then click OK. The node circles will
have turned green, indicating that the
nodes have conditions on them, as shown                   1              5
in figure 2.3.8.
                                         4                1       4
                                                  3       1.000   1.000
   •Note: if you make a mistake, or for           1.000    2
   example, accidentally create the
   wrong type of condition, select the
   condition by clicking on it, and
   then click the “Remove” button. If
   you want to start over, click the                      2
   “Remove All” button.                                    1.000

Now we’ll optimize to find a base. Select
Optimize Scale from the Action menu.
When the run is complete, you should              5        3
                                           6                     6
have something that looks like figure              1.000          1.000  7
2.3.9.

The scale of this is 0.3388 and you can
generate the crease pattern if you like by             2.3.8
selecting Build Polys and Creases.
However, it’s often possible to find a
different crease pattern with possibly a                  1
larger scale (which gives a larger base)           2            2
for exactly the same tree and conditions.
                                        4                 1                 5
You can find other patterns by starting                   0.600
                                                 3                 4
from a different initial configuration of        1.000             1.000
nodes.                                                     2

In particular, whenever you have a large,
many-sided polygon as we do here, it’s    2                              2
often possible to get a larger crease
                                                          2
pattern if you drag one of the nodes                       0.750
inside the polygon. In this case, node 1 is
the obvious candidate. If you try to click  3                           3
and drag directly, node 1 won’t move
because it’s pinned, but you can always
option-click and drag even a pinned                        3
node. So, option-click on node 1 and                5          6
                                                    1.000       1.000
drag it down into the middle of the crease    6           3          7
pattern, as shown in figure 2.3.10.
