    8.2 Version History

 (1.0) 05-01-93. Original TreeMaker program. Edits nodes and edges and finds optimum
distribution of nodes but no creases. Written in Symantec's THINK Pascal 5.0 using the THINK
Class Library, v. 1.1.

(2.0) 08-06-93. Added CPath object and an editor for same. You can now individually change
the length of a path, as well as control its angle and/or its collinearity with another node.
Numerous small changes in user interface. Version 2.0 documents are incompatible with version
1.0 application and vice versa.

(2.0.1) 03-11-94. Changed the scale box to display 5 digits of accuracy.

(2.0.2) 03-31-94. Added “Show All Paths” to the Action menu so you can toggle paths on and
off with a keystroke.

(3.0a1) 03-01-95. Complete from-the-ground-up rewrite in C++, using Metrowerks CodeWarrior
and the Metrowerks PowerPlant class library. Completely restructured mathematical model,
improved scale optimization routines, added secondary optimization, many new constraints, text-
based file format, computation of molecule creases, and other stuff too numerous to mention.
(3.0b1) 06-25-95. First beta version.

• Added universal molecules and removed computation of tristate creases for compatibility with
universal molecules.

• Added “diag” and “book” preset buttons to Tree Editor.
(3.0) 08-18-95 released.

• Fixed bug in computation of inset creases for nearly-parallel lines.

• Increased weight on “Stick to Edge” and “Collinear Node” constraints, which improves
optimizations when many nodes are present.

• Finished documentation and uploaded for distribution to origami-L archives.
(3.5) 12-22-95 released.

• Generally improved consistency of dialogs and validation:

• In all dialogs, controls and edit fields are disabled and blanked if they’re not appropriate (e.g.,
symmetry-related controls are disabled if the tree doesn’t have a symmetry line defined).

• All editors now use a common syntax (“FillDialog”) for initializing the dialog.
