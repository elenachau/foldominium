There are five polygons: four triangles and a quadrilateral. Although we could build a crease
pattern from this, we can also break the entire crease pattern into triangles. Select the
Triangulate Tree command, Action menu, which adds a stub to the tree and breaks the lower
 polygon into four triangles, as shown in figure 4.5.25.
