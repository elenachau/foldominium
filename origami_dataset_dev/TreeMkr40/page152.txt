There are four main groups of modules. Two — PowerPlant and CFSQP — are libraries written
by other guys. One — “My libraries” — is written by me. The fourth group —“TreeMaker
Classes” — is composed of the classes unique to TreeMaker. A brief discussion of these four
groups follows.

      Metrowerks PowerPlant

PowerPlant is a Macintosh class library supplied with the Metrowerks CodeWarrior family of
compilers. It provides a complete set of classes for building a Macintosh user interface, as well as
a number of useful utility classes. The user interface of TreeMaker is built from the PowerPlant
class library.

PowerPlant is Mac-specific. This makes porting TreeMaker to any other platform a bit of an
undertaking. PowerPlant is a very complex library and is the subject of a 600-page manual (The
PowerPlant Book), so I won’t bother trying to describe any more here.

PowerPlant is itself composed of several independent modules, some of which can stand alone.
One of them, the LArray class, as shown above, serves as the base for a number of my own
class libraries.
