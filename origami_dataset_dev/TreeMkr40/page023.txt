When you ran the optimization, you saw
that the figure almost instantly became
symmetric and the final pattern of
terminal nodes is now symmetric.
(Observe, though, that the internal nodes
and edges are right where we left them.)
If you select Creases Only (from the
View menu) and   Build Polys and
Creases (from the Action menu), you
will see the full crease pattern, which is
also mirror-symmetric, as shown in
figure 2.2.13.

Note the scale of the model (shown at the
top of the window) is now 0.272 (it was
0.277 with the asymmetric structure).
The scale has dropped, meaning that the
base folded from this pattern is slightly
smaller than the asymmetric base. In
general, when you add constraints to a
pattern, you will reduce the scale and                2.2.13
thus the size of the finished model.

We can also try the other line of symmetry. Select Edit Tree… from the Edit menu to open the
Tree Editor. Click on the “diag” button, which sets up a line of symmetry along one of the
diagonals of the square and click OK. Also, put the square back into Default View if it wasn’t
there already.

Now the node pattern is still symmetric

                                                          1
symmetry; observe that the green line of 6                1.000             7
symmetry in figure 2.2.14 is now along                    11

we imposed are no longer satisfied.                  14       15
Nothing has moved because conditions                  34
aren’t enforced until we re-optimize.     2               1              2

Again select the command Optimize                           1.000

creases have disappeared. Whenever you          4         3        5

a node, the polygons that used to include
