There are no editable fields of a path, other than the controls for adding conditions. The
uneditable fields of the Path Editor do tell you some useful information; they are:

min length — the minimum length (in unscaled tree units) this path is allowed

current length — the current length of the path (in unscaled tree units)

current angle — the current angle of the path with respect to the x-axis.

There is also a set of controls for adding conditions to the path.

At the lower left corner, clicking on the disclosure triangle toggles between normal and expert
mode as shown in figure 4.4.6.
