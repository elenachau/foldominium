 allows all of the edge strains to become variables as well as the node positions, but it seeks the
 minimum amount of distortion (specifically, it minimizes the RMS strain of the tree).

 This type of optimization is one of the most difficult from a numerical analysis perspective, as
 there are a great many equality constraints and they are frequently not independent (i.e., you’ll
 find that internally, there are two different constraints that are saying essentially the same thing).
 In this case, the optimizer becomes very sensitive to round-off errors (even in double-precision
 math) and TreeMaker will frequently think it is unable to find a solution.

 Such is the case here. Although you will see the nodes move around, you’ll probably be
 presented with the following dialog:


                                      3.5.8

 In this case, TreeMaker actually did find a solution. So click on the “Continue” button.

You’ll see that the pattern of nodes
shown in figure 3.5.9 is very similar to
what it was before, but now the edges are                 4
slightly strained. All of the paths we put
conditions on are now running at                 3      3          3
multiples of 22.5°.                                      1.000+1.4%
