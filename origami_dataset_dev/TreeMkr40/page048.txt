With only 3 or 4 flaps in the tree, they
will almost inevitably be edge flaps.
However, even with as few as 5 flaps,           3
                                                                       2
you will find that one or more flap will
tend to move into the middle. For
example, suppose we want a base with                2           1
five equal-length flaps. Construct a tree            1.000      1.000
as shown in figure 3.3.1.

arrangments of node circles, shown in                            1.000
figure 3.3.1. If you start with the initial             4               6
configuration above, then you will                       1.000
probably wind up with the solution
shown in figure 3.3.2, which has a scale
of 0.323.                                               5
