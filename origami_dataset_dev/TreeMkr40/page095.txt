   Remove Polygons                     1B
 This command removes all polygons. If you are working with arranging nodes, the presence of
 polygons can be a distraction; this command gets rid of them all.
    Build Creases                      1B
 Build all of the creases in the crease pattern. Creases will only be built for existing polygons, so
 you need to have built all polygons prior to calling this routine.

 A typical sequence of commands after defining the tree might be:

 1. Optimize Scale to maximize the scale and get the largest possible base.

 2. Select All followed by Optimize Selection to maximize any unpinned edges.

3. Build Polygons.

4. Triangulate Tree (optional)

5. Build Creases.

By the time you are done, the main window is likely to be rather cluttered, so itâ€™s a good idea to
select Creases Only to display just the crease pattern. The figures below illustrate this entire
sequence.

First, draw the initial tree as shown in figure 4.5.21.
