Of course, you can always simply create
creases directly, which results in the
universal molecule, as shown in figure
3.4.11.

This shows, once again, that there are
many ways to get the same number of
flaps.

   3.5 Forcing symmetric angles

One of the major enhancements in
TreeMaker 4.0 is that you can force
active paths to lie at specific angles. Why
would you want to do this?

Once you have computed and folded a
number of  TreeMaker designs, you’ll
discover that only rarely will the edges of
each flap line up with each other. That’s
because a flap is composed of a bunch of              3.4.11
triangles coming together and when
TreeMaker optimizes a base, there’s no
particular reason for it to make the angles of one triangle equal to those of the adjacent layers.

If you could force all angles to be the same, or one of a small set of similar angles, then you’d get
a base in which more layers tend to line up.

An additional benefit of this is that if all the major creases run along fairly standard angles, you
run a better chance of being able to construct reference points by folding and/or a sequential
folding sequence, rather than measuring for reference points and a folding sequence that consists
of a single “bring all these creases together at once.”

If we are to force major creases to lie at “standard” angles, which angles should we choose? A
natural set of angles are those that are obtained by dividing a circle into an integral number of
equal divisions: for example, the common 22.5° degree angle found in the Bird Base is obtained
by dividing a circle into 16 parts. While this is the most common division, several others provide
useful and interesting bases: division into 12 parts gives multiples of 30° and crease patterns with
many equilateral triangles in them.
