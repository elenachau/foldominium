This yields the crease pattern shown in
figure 3.1.8.

Suppose after seeing the result, we didn’t
want to do this after all. You can remove
the node by deleting node 10. But you
will still be left with an extra node in the
middle of the model. A node with only
two edges connected is called a
“redundant node.” You can remove a
single redundant node by selecting it and
choosing the command Absorb Selected
Node from the    Action menu.
Alternatively, you can select the
command Absorb Redundant Nodes to
remove all redundant nodes from a tree.

   3.2  Making a plan view model

Flat origami models come in two distinct
types, which correspond to two different               3.1.8
views of the subject. The most common
is a “side view” model, which resembles
the silhouette of the subject viewed from the side. (You can often make a side view model three-
dimensional by opening out the body from the underside, but the base is still fundamentally side
view.) Using TreeMaker, it is very easy to make side view models.

 However, many models — especially insects — look better in “plan view,” that is, viewed as if
 you were looking down on them from above. Some of the time, you can make a plan view model
 out of a side view base by spreading the layers of the model to the left and right and flattening
 the result. But oftentimes, the base has an odd number of layers, or the layers don’t spread
 sufficiently far apart, or it is necessary to spread-sink one or more corners in a way that ends up
 reducing the length of the attached points. For example, let’s take the regular human tree (equal-
 length head, arms, legs, and body) oriented along the book direction.
