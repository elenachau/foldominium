 Whenever we add a new node inside a polygon, if we make the corresponding flap sufficiently
 large, it forms several new active paths with the vertices of the old active polygon. In the process,
 it breaks up the polygon into smaller polygons with fewer sides than the original polygon. In
 figure 5.21, adding the new point has broken the five-sided polygon into one quadrilateral and
 three triangles. But we already know crease patterns for quadrilaterals and triangles! Filling in
 the crease patterns in each polygon gives a crease pattern for the full base, shown in figure 5.22.

Figure 5.22. Crease pattern for the 5-pointed base.
Imagining terminal nodes as being surrounded by circles makes it easier to visualize the path
constraints of the tree theorem. Although strictly speaking, the circle analogy only holds for
terminal nodes with exactly one internal node between them, one can devise a similar condition
for more widely separated nodes. If you draw in circular arcs around each terminal node tangent
to the tri-state creases, you get a set of contours on both the crease pattern and the base, in which
edges attached to terminal nodes are represented by circles and edges attached only to internal
nodes are represented by contours that snake through the crease pattern as in figure 5.23. For
numerical computation, I find that it is simpler to do all calculations in terms of paths and path
lengths, but for intuition and visualization, the circles and contours constitute an equivalent and
more easily visualized tool for devising new crease patterns.
