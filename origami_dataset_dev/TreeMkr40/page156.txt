          Optimizer Classes

 Optimizer classes perform mathematical operations on the Tree that generate a valid crease
 pattern. Optimizer classes are At present, there are four optimizer classes:
 ScaleOptimizer

 EdgeOptimizer

 StrainOptimizer

 StubFinder

 These four classes do the mathematical “heavy lifting”; they actually solve for particular creases
 patterns. They are derived from pure numerical classes (NewtonRaphson and Cpfsqp).

 ScaleOptimizer finds the arrangement of nodes that gives the largest possible crease
 pattern.

 EdgeOptimizer selectively increases particular edges to their largest possible size.

 StrainOptimizer is used in heavily constrained situations; it finds a configuration that
 minimizes the strain on the edges.

 StubFinder is a simple solver that adds stubs to a tree to break high-order polygons into
 lower-order polygons.

 The three optimizer classes inherit from the TreeOptimizer class, which embodies platform-
dependent behaviors: cancellation, error messages, and showing of progress.

To support the optimizers, there are a number of DifferentiableFunction objects that
are used for constraints and objective functions for the optimizers.
