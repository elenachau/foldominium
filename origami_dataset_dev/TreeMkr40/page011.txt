At this stage of the game, you can click
on nodes and edges and move them about
rather easily because none of them are
pinned. Click on nodes 7 and 8 and drag
them upward so that they lie above node
4, as shown in figure 2.1.6.

When you have defined the stick figure,
it’s time to start computing the crease
pattern. Go to the Action menu and
select the command, Optimize Scale.
This starts the computation of the crease
pattern. You can tell that the calculation
is running from two things: first, the
positions of the nodes will change and
move around, and second, the cursor
turns into a piece of paper that is folding
and unfolding itself. The calculation will
take anywhere from several minutes (on
a Mac IIcx) to a few seconds (on a Power
Mac).                                                  2.1.6
   • Note: if you get tired of waiting
   during a calculation, you can always interrupt it by pressing Command-Period.

   • Note: most of the actions in TreeMaker are not easily undoable (the Undo command in
   the Edit menu usually isn’t enabled). It’s a good idea to save figures before you run an
   optimization, in case you don’t like the results.
