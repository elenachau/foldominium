   6.6   Conditions

In addition to the conditions specified above, which are always required to be satisfied, one can
optionally impose additional conditions on the crease pattern that are typically strict equalities.
These are easily incorporated into the nonlinear constrained optimization machinery. The
conditions and related equations currently implemented in TreeMaker are listed below.

      Node position fixed

A node ui  that has one or both of its coordinates fixed to a point a must satisfy one or both of the
 equations

                                     −    =
                                  ui, x ai, x 0
                                     −    =
                                  ui, y ai, y 0
      Node fixed to corner of paper

A node ui  that is constrained to lie on a corner of the paper must satisfy both equations

                                 ()−    ⋅=
                                 ui,x w  ui,x0

                                 ()ui,yhui,y0
       Node fixed to edge of paper

 A node ui  that is fixed to lie on the edge of the paper must satisfy the equation

                           ()−    ⋅⋅−⋅=
                            ui,x w ui,x()ui,yhui,y0
       Node fixed to line
                                                               α
 A node ui  that is constrained to lie on a line through point a running at angle , such as a line of
symmetry, must satisfy the equation

                         ()u − a cosα − ()u − a sinα = 0
                           i,x x         i,y y        .
       Two nodes paired about a line

 Two nodes ui  and u j  that are constrained to be mirror-symmetric about a line through point a
 running at angle α, such as a line of symmetry, must satisfy the two equations
