 Object   References          What

 Node     mOwnedVertices      The vertex associated with this node

          mEdges              Edges connected to this node

          mPaths              Paths that terminate on this node (not paths that
                              contain this node)

          mNodeOwner          Poly or tree that owns this node
 Edge

 A Edge is the data structure that represents an edge of the top-level planar graph. An Edge
 connects two Nodes. Each Edge corresponds to a flap (or segment) of a base.

          mEdgeOwner          Tree that owns this edge
 Path

 A Path is an object that describes a particular relationship between two Nodes. Terminal paths
 connect terminal nodes. A Path has associated with it a length, which is the minimum length
 between two nodes of the graph.

 A “tree path” is a path owned by the Tree. Tree paths have a list of edges and internal nodes
that represents the path along the tree from which its length is derived.

A “poly path” is a path owned by a Poly. Poly paths have their lengths computed by reducing
the length of the original path from which it is derived.
