 Node fixed to corner

                                       4.5.30

This condition insures that a node lies on one of the four corners of the paper. It’s used to make a
flap a corner flap. The fields are:

— the index of the node
Node fixed to edge

                                       4.5.31

This condition insures that a node lies on one of the edges of the paper. It’s used to make  flap an
edge flap. The fields are:

— the index of the node
Node fixed to symmetry line

                                       4.5.32

This condition insures that a node lies on the symmetry line of the model. It’s used to make flaps
that lie on the center line of a bilaterally symmetric subject. The fields are:

— the index of the node
Nodes paired

                                       4.5.33

This condition insures that two nodes are mirror images of each other about the symmetry line of
the base. It’s used to make two identical flaps on the left and right sides of the model. The fields
are:

— the index of the first node
