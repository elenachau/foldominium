 where lij  is the path length between nodes i and j measured along the tree graph. There is an
 analogous condition for reduced polygons; any two vertices of a reduced polygon must satisfy
 the condition

 and i is the angle between the bisector of corner i and the adjacent side. I call equation (2) the
 reduced path constraint for a reduced polygon of inset distance h. Any path for which the
 reduced path constraint becomes an equality is, in analogy with active paths between nodes,
 called an active reduced path.

 So for any distance h, we have a unique reduced polygon and a set of reduced path constraints,
each of which corresponds to one of the original path constraints. We have already assumed that
all of the original path constraints are met; thus, we know that all of the reduced path constraints
are met for the h=0 case (no inset distance). It can also be shown that there is always some
positive nonzero value of h for which the reduced path constraints hold. On the other hand, as we
increase the inset distance, there comes a point beyond which one or more of the reduced path
constraints is violated. Suppose we increase h to the largest possible value for which every
reduced path constraint remains true. At the maximum value of h, one or both of the following
conditions will hold:

(1) For two adjacent corners, the reduced path length has fallen to zero and the two inset corners
are degenerate; or

(2) For two nonadjacent corners, a path between inset corners has become an active reduced
path.

These two situations are illustrated in figure 5.25.
