If you set up the tree and symmetry line
and run an optimization, you will arrive                  1
at the arrangement of nodes shown in
                                                 2                 2

get the crease pattern shown in figure
3.2.2.                                    2                              2

Now the problem with this crease pattern                  2
is that if you fold it up into a side view                 1.000
base, there is only one layer on the top,    3                        3
and if you try to squash-fold the layer to
spread the arms and legs to either side                    3
and make a plan view base, you’ll find               5         6
that the base of the squash fold reduces             1.000     1.000
                                                6         3        7
the effective length of the legs
considerably.

That’s because we have overlooked an
important requirement for making a plan
view base. The way you make a side
view base into a plan view base is to
open the model along the line of
symmetry, which means that all of the
paper along the line of symmetry must lie
in the same plane to form the “hinge” of
the base. Put differently, the line of
symmetry of the paper must lie in the
plane of projection of the base. This
means that to make a plan view base, the
line of symmetry of the square must
consist entirely of active paths (since
active paths are the only parts of the base
that lie in the plane of projection of the
base).

So we need to get active paths running
along the line of symmetry. But since
active paths only run between nodes of
the tree and there is currently only one
node on the line of symmetry (the head),               3.2.2
we need to add more nodes to the tree
solely for the purpose of creating active paths. These nodes don’t correspond to features of the
model; they’re only there to make the base a plan view base. In particular, we need to add a node
to the bottom of the square so that there is a terminus on the bottom edge of the square for the
active paths that are to run along the line of symmetry.
