Your figure should look something like
this but it probably wonâ€™t look exactly
the same. You should see some red lines,
however. The red lines are paths that are 4                                 5
not valid, meaning that their actual length      3                 4
is less than their minimum length. They          1.000     2       1.000
are a sign that no valid crease pattern is                 1
possible with this arrangement of nodes.                    0.600

Again, select Optimize Scale from the
Action menu to find a new configuration.                  2
