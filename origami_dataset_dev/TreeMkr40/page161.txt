    public:
       short mIndex;
       Tree* mTree;
 }
 References to objects are made visible to the user by the mIndex, the value of which is set by
 the owner of the part (see below). Given a reference to any Part, the mTree reference gives
 access to the overall Tree. All TreeMaker objects inherit from Part as shown below:

                                       Node
                                       Edge
                             Part
                                       Path
                                       Poly
                                       Condition
                                       Vertex
                                       Crease
                                      7.9

 Conversely, the Tree has a set of lists of references to all Parts with names like mNodes,
mEdges, mPaths, etc. This provides flat access to the hierarchical data structure; it simplifies
searching over the Parts and lets us assign the Part index according to its position within the
master list.

      Ownership

The data structures in TreeMaker are tied together by various relations. One important set of
relations is the concept of “ownership.” Every object is owned by another object. The chain of
ownership is a simple rooted tree, that is, every object has a unique owner, which in turn has a
unique owner, all the way up to the Tree at the top of the hierarchy. (It’s similar to a “chain of
command.”)

Ownership confers two important properties:

      When an owner object is deleted, it deletes all of the objects that it owns

      An owner object can be interrogated about objects that it owns, for example, to return an
object that satisfies certain criteria.

Ownership ability is conferred through inheritance. The chain of ownership is shown in the
figure below. Objects to the right inherit from objects to the left.
