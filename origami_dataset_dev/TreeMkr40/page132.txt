 Since every polygon network can be broken up into triangles and quads by the addition of extra
 circles, the triangle and quad molecules are by themselves sufficient for filling in the crease
 pattern for any tree. However, there are many other possible molecules, including molecules that
 can be used for higher-order polygons. It turns out that the gusset quad is just a special case of a
 more general construction that is applicable to any higher-order polygon. I call this construction
 the universal molecule. In fact, many of the known molecules — the Maekawa and Meguro
 molecules, the rabbit ear, and so forth (but not the arrowhead quad, as it turns out) are special
 cases of the universal molecule. The rest of this article describes the construction of this
 molecule for an arbitrary polygon.

 Consider a general polygon that satisfies the tree theorem, i.e., any two vertices are separated by
 a distance greater than or equal to their separation on the tree graph. Since we are considering a
 single active polygon, we know that of the paths between nonadjacent vertices, none are at their
 minimum length (otherwise it would be an active path and the polygon would have been split).

 Suppose we inset the boundary of the polygon by a distance h, as shown in figure 5.24. If the
                                                                      ′  ′
 original vertices of the polygon were A1, A2,… then we will label the inset vertices A1 , A2 ,… as
 we did for the gusset quad construction. I will call the inset polygon a reduced polygon of the
 original polygon.

 Figure 5.24. A reduced polygon is inset a distance h inside of an active polygon. The inset
corners lie on the angle bisectors (dotted lines) emanating from each corner.
                   ′
 Note that the points Ai  lie on the bisectors emanating from the points Ai for any h. Consider first
a reduced polygon that is inset by an infinitesimally small amount. In the folded base, the sides
of the reduced polygon all lie in a common plane, just as the sides of the original active polygon
all lie in a common plane; however, the plane of the sides of the reduced polygon is offset from
the plane of the sides of the active polygon by a perpendicular distance h. As we increase h, we
shrink the size of the reduced polygon. Is there a limit to the shrinkage? Yes, there is, and this
limit is the key to the universal molecule. Recall that for any polygon that satisfies the tree
theorem, the path between any two vertices satisfies a path length constraint
