If you allow one of the nodes to start in
the middle of the square, you will      4                                   2
probably arrive at the solution in figure
3.3.3, which is significantly larger with a
scale of 0.353.

efficient crease pattern will have at least       1.000             1.000

were able to force all of the flaps to be                 3
edge flaps simply by starting from an
