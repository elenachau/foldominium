If you Build Polygons and Creases you
will get the crease pattern shown in
figure 3.5.3.

The creases in this design don’t precisely
fall on standard angles. We’ll modify it
so that they do. We do this by putting a
“Path angle quantized” condition on all
of the paths that correspond to major
creases.

Put the model back into Default View
and select the Kill Polygons command,
Actions menu, to put in back into the
configuration shown in figure N. In this
case, only the polygon paths are shown.
Select the Select all polygon paths
command,  Edit menu. Then select Path
angle quantized… from the Conditions
menu. This puts up the dialog shown in
figure 3.5.4.                                          3.5.3


                                      3.5.4

 This will place a condition that forces each of the selected paths to be active (so it will be a major
 crease) and to lie at an angle that is a multiple of 180°/N, where N is an integer. Common values
 of N and the corresponding angle are:
