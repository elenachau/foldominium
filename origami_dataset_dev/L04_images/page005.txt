Architectural Origami                      Pattern
                                           - 2D Pattern

•  Origami Architecture
    Direct application of Origami for Design - Static Shape
    – Design is highly restricted by the symmetry 
      of the original pattern
    – Freeform design results in losing important 
      property (origami-inspired design)     Design    Apply
•  Architectural Origami
   Origami theory for Design               Conditions
   –  Extract characteristics of origami   - 3D shape in motion
   –  Obtain solution space of forms from  - Behavior
      the required condition and design
