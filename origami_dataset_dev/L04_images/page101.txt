Hinge Shift Approach

•  Main Problem
    – non-concurrent edges →6 
      constraints (overconstrained)
•  Symmetric Vertex:
    – [Hoberman 88]
    – use two levels of thickness
    – works only if the vertex is 
      symmetric (a = b, c=d=π-a)
•  Slidable Hinges
    – [Trautz and Kunstler 09]
    – Add extra freedom by allowing 
      „slide“
    – Problem: global accumulation of 
      slide (not locally designable)
