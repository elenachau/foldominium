Developable Surface

•  Smooth Developable Surface
    –  G2 surface (curvature continuous) 
        • "Developable Surface" (in a narrow 
          sense)
        • Plane, Cylinder, Cone, Tangent 
          surface
    –  G1 Surface (smooth, tangent 
       continuous)                         pl ane    cyl i nder  cone     t angent
        • "Uncreased flat surface"
        • piecewise Plane, Cylinder, Cone, 
          Tangent surface
