Objective of the Study

1.     freeform
       –   Controlled 3D form
       –   Fit function, design context, 
           preference, ...

2.     origami
       utilize the properties
       –   Developability
             →  Manufacturing from a sheet material
                 based on Folding, Bending
       –   Flat-foldability
             →   Folding into a compact configuration
                 or Deployment from 2D to 3D
       –   Rigid-foldability
             →   Transformable
                 Structure
       –   Elastic Properties
       ...
