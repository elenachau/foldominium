Thickening

    • Rigid origami is ideal 
      surface (no thickness)
    • Reality:
       – There is thickness
       – To make “rigid” 
         panels, thickness must 
         be solved 
         geometrically
    • Modified Model:
       – Thick plates
       – Rotating hinges at the 
         edges
