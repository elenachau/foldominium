Flat-foldability condition to be used

    – Isometry
          Alternating sum of angles is 0 [Kawasaki 
          1989]
        ⇔
                       kv
                Fv  = ∑       ()i θi = 0sgn
                      i=0
    – Layering
           [kawasaki 1989]

            – If θi is between foldlines assigned with MM 
        ⇒    or VV,
             θi    min(θi−1,θi+1)
        + empirical condition [tachi 2007]
                ≧
            – If θi and θi+1 are composed byfoldlines
             assigned with MMV or VVM then, θi
             θi+1
                                         ≧
