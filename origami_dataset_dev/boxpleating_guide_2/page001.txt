         How to fold Box Pleated CPs
                          Part 1I - Precreasing
The first step in precreasing for a box pleated CP is do precrease the whole grid. This might not be
necessary for all models but in general it is easier to prefold all creases instead of determining which
creases are necessary.
What we need to know first is the size of the grid, so (if this information is not given along with the
CP) we’ll just have to count the number units across one side of the CP.
For my Porcupine model the grid is 32 x 32 units.
The creases will be alternating valley and mountain folds. When you are using duo-colour paper, with
the colour-side down the outermost creases have to be valley folds for a coloured model. The next
picture shows this for an 8 x 8 units grid.


Now if the grid size is of the form 2n, like 32 for my Porcupine, the precreasing is quite trivial.
Let’s look at how to fold an 8 x 8 grid as example.

        both ways.         the centre.           between the
                                              mountain creases.
So for divisions of 2, 4, 6, 16, 32, 64 etc. the precreasing is easy to do. But what are we supposed to
do with divisions like 24, 40, 56, etc.
To solve this problem we first have to go back to elementary maths and make a prime factorization
of the number we need.
                                 24 = 2*2*2*3
                                  40 = 2*2*5
                                 56 = 2*2*2*7
That means that for a 24 x 24 grid, we first need to divide the paper in thirds and then subdivide the
thirds into eigths (2*2*2=8), which is easy once we have the thirds.
