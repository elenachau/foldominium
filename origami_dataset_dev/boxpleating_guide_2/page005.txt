If you need a division like 9 (=3*3) or 15 = (3*5) or similar, you can either use one of the methods at
http://www.origami.gr.jp/People/CAGE_/divide/index-e.html to give you this division directly or (f.e.
if you don’t have the tables for the methods at hand) use a recursive approach with the methods you
already know. I’ll give you an example of this with a 9 x 9 grid.


First divide the paper into thirds with the method from before.
Then focus on the top right square.


You can use the exactly same method as before to divide
this small square into thirds as well.


With the reference lines you now have, you can easily
fold the rest of the 9 x 9 grid.


Now that you have the finished grid you have all the reference points you need to fold the diagonals
shown in the CP. I usually make the diagonals as valley folds on the white side (mountain folds on the
coloured side). But since you will need them both ways you can fold them any way you like.

With all the creases made we can now start the long and tedious collapsing process.
