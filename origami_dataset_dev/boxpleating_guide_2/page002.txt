To divide the paper into thirds we can use several different methods.
More information about these methods including the famous Haga theorems can be found at
http://www.origami.gr.jp/People/CAGE_/divide/index-e.html
Here’s the method I always use.


                              2. Precrease the diagonal
            1. Fold in half       but only where shown.
                both ways.                       3. Fold between the shown
                                                     points but only mark the
                                                     intersection with the
                                                     diagonal.


      6. Division into thirds done.
                              5. Fold the two other sides 4. Fold the sides to the
                                  to the creases made      marked intersection
                                  in step 4 and unfold.     and unfold.

Now that we have thirds, all we have to do is the following:
    1. Add creases in the middle of the thirds to get sixths
    2. Add creases between the sixths to get 12ths.
    3. Turn the paper over.
    4. Add creases between the 12ths to get the intended 24ths.
So in general (beware, some mathematics ahead) to get a grid of 2(n+1)*m units, with m being an odd
number, first you have to make a grid of m x m units.
That’s where the methods at http://www.origami.gr.jp/People/CAGE_/divide/index-e.html can help.
I’ll show you how to get some more divisions (the most common ones) on the next pages.
For the reference points in these methods you will mostly need halves, 4ths, 8ths and the like. In most
cases you will need those creases for the CP anyway. If you don’t need them just create them as pinches
on the paper edge where they are needed.
Once you have the m x m grid, you only need to subdivide the division in half and in half again and
so on until you have reached  a 2n*m division. All of the creases so far have been valley folds on the
coloured side. Now you turn the paper over and subdivide in half a last time to get the final 2(n+1)*m
grid.
