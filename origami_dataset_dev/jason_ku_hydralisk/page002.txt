With the colour side up, pleat the whole square as shown below on the existing creases.


Now comes probably the most tedious part of this model. You have to introduce the structure in the
middle as shown below. Itâ€™s best to start at the top and work down to the bottom. You have to do both
sides in parallel. Also you should note that the horizontal creases in this part (valley = red,mountain
= blue, again with colour side up) are opposite from how you precreased them.
In the photo on the right you see the result of this step.
