Now that you know how they are folded, make belly plates from the circled areas, starting from the
bottom. For the red ones you open the layers from above (steps 3-8) for the orange ones you open the
layers from underneath (steps 9-11). The according precreased squares which you will need are marked
in the same colours in the CP.


                         On the left side of this picture the belly plates are already completed.
                         Now do the same for the other side.
                         With this the base for the Hydralisk is completed and “all” that is
                         left to do is to shape the model to your liking.

                         If you compare the pictures of how my Hydralisk looks on the next
                         page and how the original Hydralisk by Jason Ku looks on his
                         homepage, you will see that they are not very similiar, while both
                         of them look like a Hydralisk. So you have a lot of freedom in
                         finishing the model and there’s not really many hints I can give you
                         for that except to play around a bit and shape until you like the
                         model. Some pages earlier I’ve also showed what parts of the base
                         will become what parts in the finished model so that should give
                         you a pretty good idea what to do.
                         Have fun!
