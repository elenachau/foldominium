 The underlying structure to this model is the following box pleated CP based on 32x32 grid. So you
 will start with precreasing the 32x32 grid.
 With the colour side up, the outermost creases would be mountain folds and then alternating valley-
 mountain-valley-etc.
 With the grid done add the necessary diagonals (black) as shown in the CP below. The red creases,
 while not necessary for collapsing the base CP, will help you a lot later on, so add them as well.


Note: Disregard the colour differences in the different photos. Some of them turned out better with
flash and some turned out better without.
