We’re going to work with the lower right corner of the CP which corresponds to the area circled in
red from the previous page. To make things a bit clearer I’m going to assume that you are using a
separate piece of paper for just this part of the CP (based on an 8x8 grid) and it would be a good idea
for you to do just that for a first attempt, before forming the belly plates on the real model.
As with all the drawings so far, the colour of the final model is on top.


                              2. Collapse.
 1. Fold an 8x8 grid and
add the shown diagonals.
                                                      3. This is similar to the area
                                                     circled in red from the previous
                                                     page. Open up the layers where
                                                       the precreased square is.


         4. Form the shown creases pushing up the mountain
        fold from underneath, and then flatten the model. Also
         note the corresponding creases in the CP on the left.


                                            6. Push in the central flap, forming the valley
                                            fold shown in the CP on the existing crease.

    5. Fold and unfold the flap in half both ways,
     introducing the creases shown in the CP.
