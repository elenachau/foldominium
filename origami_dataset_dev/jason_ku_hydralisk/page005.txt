                              Sink the sides, following the
                              existing creases.
Open out the layers and form
the shown folds on the existing
creases.
The horizontal and vertical
mountain folds won’t connect
to the rest of the model, just
make them as far as possible to
make the next step easier.                            Spread squash the central flap
                                                      and close the arm flap.


                                The resulting CP.
                                Repeat for the other arm.

       This is what you should have so far, with the position of the main body parts.

                                                         Next we will work
                                                         on this area to start
                                                         forming the “belly
