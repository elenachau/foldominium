                             Form the blue creases as mountain
                             folds to get three distinct points.
                             Collapse this part flat by bringing
                             the outer points towards the middle
Carefully pull out the layers from point.                  The result. Repeat those steps
the inside in front and on the back.                       for the flap behind as well.


                 The CP so far. Next weâ€™re going to work on the arm.
