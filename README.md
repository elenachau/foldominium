# Foldominium Origami Simulator

## Project Description

Foldominium is a sophisticated origami simulator designed to create any origami design with ease. Our simulator provides crease patterns and step-by-step folding guides via prompt engineering. The goal is to reduce user overhead with easy-to-follow steps and enable real-life applications like robotics and deployable products.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with simple commands.
- **Strain Visualization**: Real-time strain visualization for complex designs.
- **Real-time Simulation**: GPU-accelerated WebGL for dynamic folding processes.
- **Material Properties**: Accurate modeling of different materials.
- **Machine Learning**: Accurate modeling of 3D geometry and folding patterns using ML.

## Goals

- Accurately represent 3D geometry and folding patterns.
- Model the dynamic folding process.
- Develop a user-friendly prompt engineering system.
- Ensure generalization to new designs.

## Libraries and Tools

- **Three.js**: Rendering and 3D interaction.
- **svgpath & path-data-polyfill**: SVG path parsing.
- **FOLD API**: Data structures and SVG parsing.
- **Earcut & cdt2d**: Triangulating polygonal faces.
- **numeric.js**: Linear algebra.
- **CCapture**: GIF/WebM export.
